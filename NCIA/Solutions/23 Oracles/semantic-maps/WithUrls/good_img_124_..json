Two types of internships are available: CoR Traineeship or Short-term study visits. CoR traineeship Each year, the CoR offers young university graduates a limited number of five-month traineeships. These training periods involve work experience in one of the Committee of the Regions' services, and run from 16 February until 15 July (spring traineeships) or from 16 September until 15 February (autumn traineeships). The purpose of the organisation of traineeships in the CoR is: to provide a first-hand experience of the workings of the CoR and of the EU institutions in general; to provide practical knowledge of the working of its departments; to work in a multicultural and multilingual environment; to enable trainees to have the opportunity to organise a study visit to a European local or regional authority, in connection with the Committee's political priorities; to enable trainees to develop and put into practice the knowledge they have acquired during their studies or personal careers. Trainees are selected from nationals of the EU Member States. However a limited number of nationals of non-member countries may be accepted. Applicants must: either hold a university degree (or an equivalent diploma) awarded by the closing date for applications; have a thorough knowledge of one official Community language and a satisfactory knowledge of one other EU-working language (French or English). CoR-trainees are entitled to a monthly grant. The amount of the grant is equivalent to 25% of the salary of AD*5 officials (step 1) at the start of the traineeship for the full 5-month period. A monthly supplement of EUR 100 is given to married trainees whose spouses are not gainfully employed and to trainees who have dependent children (EUR100, 00/child/month). A supplementary grant amounting to up to half of the monthly grant may be granted to a handicapped trainee. Application periods: - 1st of October to 31st March, midnight, Brussels local time, of the same year (for autumn traineeships 16th September - 15thFebruary); - 1st of April to 30th September, midnight, Brussels local time, of previous year (for spring traineeships 16th February - 15th July). Applications are to be made exclusively via the Internet. The on-line application form is available here. Short-term study visits The CoR also offers short-term study visits within one of its services to persons whose professional, academic or research activities indicate that they would familiarise with the Committee's practical workings and/or policies. The nature of the tasks to be fulfilled by trainees depends largely on the unit to which they are assigned; while some units are more political, others are more administrative. Applicants must: EU citizens or citizens from a state which is an official candidate for accession (applicants of third countries may be granted a traineeship by the Secretary General in exceptional, duly motivated cases); university graduates that have completed at least a Bachelor's degree; be able to show that he/she needs to deepen his/her knowledge of the Committee of the Regions for reasons related to professional, academic or research activities. All expenses during the study period are to be covered by the beneficiaries: they receive no grant, nor any other financial support from the CoR. The maximum duration forshort-term study visit is 4 months, but it may be extended to 6 months depending on the resources available at the CoR. Deadline: There are no fixed deadlines for unpaid study periods. Applications should be sent by post to the Traineeship Office. Internships Deadline 31/03/2019 Organizers COR Committee of the Regions - Training office The Committee of the Regions is an advisory assembly of the European Union composed of 317 representatives of local and regional authorities. This unit is in charge of the stages within the COR and the Economic and Social Comittee.

Although these formal and mostly legally institutionalized tools are helpful in avoiding really bad projects and safeguarding basic qualities in city development, they are not so strong in encouraging a higher level of urban spatial quality that excels. That's why we need in urban design governance also other methods than the traditional ones, not so much formal but rather soft power by nature. Which kind of formal and informal mechanisms do exist in European cities in order to improve the quality of design projects? What are the modalities of these kinds of urban design governance? What would be the financial impact of design quality? What can we learn, in view of sharing it in a long-term network of professionals and supporting uptake in design quality policies all over Europe? The project is an initiative of a small consortium comprising The United Nations Human Settlement Programme (UN-Habitat), University College London (UCL) and the Brussels \"Bouwmeester Maitre Architecte\" (BMA), supported by the European Commission. BMA is looking for a new collaborator for this project. You can find the job description here.

For the first time in a referendum, most citizens are involved, regardless of their ethnic, religious, gender, regional or party affiliation or identity. Macedonians, Albanians, Turks, Roma and other ethnic communities have been mobilized around the common strategic goal - integration into NATO and the EU. All the varieties of society are united around the goal that guarantees freedom, dignity, progress, a better life and true democracy. A historic event, as well as a historic step that is expected to take place on Sunday, September 30th. The vote \"for\" implies a high civic awareness of the orientation towards Euro-Atlantic values and the values of European democracy. The \"for\" voice will mean opening a new perspective for all citizens, which means entering into other developmental dimensions that will directly affect the well-being of citizens, in all that means social, cultural and democratic life. The European paradigm inherently recognizes political freedoms, cultural plurality, diversity and economic development. The Balkan Institute for Regional Cooperation (BIRC), in line with these values, emphasizes the pro-referendum position as an opportunity for common values in the common space of European civilization. Over time, this orientation was a dream for all of us, a dream to become part of this paradigm that recognizes freedom, dignity and continuous cultivation of democratic values. The week is a chance to prove our willingness to open new development horizons that will be useful and essential for all generations. We need to vote for us, for our existence, for the values that we aspire to have. We only need to open our doors to this essential invitation, which ensures security, stability, normality and uplift in those dimensions that have in their epicenter the human being and all its cultural layers. We vote for ourselves, for the European values that are stuck in our space along a long-lasting and, until now, hopeless transition.

Share This Post Analysis / Business Will GDPR Change How Startups Are Funded? By Julian Saunders on January 30, 2018 No Comments 461 views The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a sweeping piece of legislation that will fundamentally change how data is used, protected and controlled. It has teeth - manifested by its big fines for breaches which the ICO are indicating they intend to exercise. However, GDPR is nothing to be feared. As has been discussed at length, it is a force for good, empowering people, promoting transparency and accountability, and a mechanism to improve marketing, customer service and a host of other business processes. A little talked about aspect of GDPR is how it could change how startups raise funding. There are three areas it could impact. The first is how investors assess the risks and benefits associated with a company. Particularly, how will it collect, store, manage and use private Data. For example, if a consumer-focused app proposes to eventually use customer data to monetise via ads, the simple question would be how likely is this to be achieved in a post-GDPR world where customers need to explicitly opt-in to marketing and can easily request for their data to be deleted? A business model that fails to consider the new marketing reality would be unlikely to gain investor confidence. Added to this is the expertise and experience a business has with ensuring proper security and management of data. With significant fines for breaches, the risks associated with a startup that has no experience with data management could be a big red flag. This will be a particular point of focus if the business is planning to provide services to other businesses as many enterprises will demand self-certification of GDPR compliance and contracted liability for data breaches and mismanagement. The second aspect, linked to the first, is using GDPR to differentiate a company. If your startup can prove that it is fully GDPR compliant and has been built on privacy by design principles it could confer numerous benefits. It could be a selling point to support business development - essentially a public vote of confidence that boosts the brand. For investors it is a clear indication of forward-thinking and maturity. It basically says that the company can deal with complicated pieces of legislation and understands the future demands of businesses in a consumer empowered world. The final area worth considering is how GDPR will impact the ability of the investor community to hold, analyse and use data. There are many avenues through which information on a prospective investment are collected and used. For some firms this involves mining of online data sources. Like every other organisation impacted by GDPR, VCs and private equity firms will need to think carefully about when consent is needed to collect data and the security arrangements around holding it. They will also need to invest in data management solutions to enable data to modified, sent to or deleted if requested. What I have discussed above is only a very brief overview of how GDPR could change startup-investor relations. The simple message to entrepreneurs is to seriously think about how to turn GDPR compliance into a selling point for their companies. This involves taking into account how the effects of GDPR will potentially change the behaviour of their target audience, as well as how their business will function. For investors, GDPR cannot be ignored when assessing the viability and potential of a business. It also cannot be ignored when considering their own data governance. data management GDPR investors startups vc Share This Post Julian Saunders Julian is the founder and CEO of PORT, a service to make complying with the new GDPR quick and simple for businesses of all sizes.

Oliver Sume, eco-Vorstandsvorsitzender, formuliert die grosse Enttauschung der Internetwirtschaft uber den Ausgang der Abstimmung: ,,Jetzt werden Plattformbetreiber dazu verpflichtet, vermeintliche Urheberrechtsverletzungen noch vor Veroffentlichung zu unterbinden. Uploadfilter sollen Inhalte schon beim Hochladen uberprufen und bei Verdacht auf einen Urheberrechtsverstoss direkt blockieren. Damit greift die EU massiv in die in die technische Grundstruktur des Internet ein und provoziert einen grundlegenden Wertewandel in der Internetregulierung. Das bedeutet einen Paradigmenwechsel in der Haftung der Provider - weg vom Prinzip ,Notice And Action', hin zu einer verbindlichen Vorabkontrolle und Zensurinfrastruktur.\" Bisher gilt das sogenannte Provider-Privileg der E-Commerce Richtlinie: Dabei handelt es sich jedoch nicht - wie ofter falschlich argumentiert wird - um einen Haftungsfreibrief, wenn Betreiber erst gegen illegale Inhalte vorgehen mussen, nachdem sie davon Kenntnis erlangt haben. Vielmehr verhindert es, dass Plattformen zur Privatjustiz gemacht werden. Die Aushohlung des Providerprivilegs ist in seiner Konsequenz ein direkter Angriff auf die Meinungsfreiheit aller, mahnt der Verband der Internetwirtschaft. ,,Damit einher geht eine erhebliche Verletzung rechtsstaatlicher Prinzipien, wenn zukunftig Unternehmen und nicht Gerichte daruber entscheiden, was wir im Internet sehen, horen und lesen durfen. Zudem wird ein europaisches Leistungsschutzrecht die Digitalisierung der Verlags- und Nachrichten-Branche erschweren, Innovation behindern und zum Wettbewerbsnachteil fur den Investitionsstandort Europa werden. Es folgt die langfristige Rechtsunsicherheit aller Akteure. Mit dem reformierten Urheberrecht wird die technikneutrale Struktur des Internet fur immer fundamental verandert.\", sagt Sume. Der Abstimmung im Rechtsausschuss kann nun der offizielle Trilog folgen. Eine letzte Hoffnung gibt die Option, dass zumindest 10 % der Europaabgeordneten das Trilogmandat im Plenum des Europaischen Parlaments anfechten konnten. eco - Verband der Internetwirtschaft e.V.

Gleichwohl ist nicht alles in bester Ordnung. Gerade ein JubilA$?um wie das aktuelle muss uns bewusstmachen, dass wir die EU einerseits dringender denn je brauchen, aber wir sie ebenso dringend reformieren mA 1/4 ssena, so der GeneralsekretA$?r der Industriellenvereinigung (IV), Christoph Neumayer, anlA$?sslich des JubilA$?ums der Unterzeichnung der aRAPmischen VertrA$?gea heute, Freitag. Insbesondere der gemeinsame Markt sowie die vier Grundfreiheiten a also der freie Verkehr von Waren, Dienstleistungen, Kapital und vor allem Menschen A 1/4 ber die nationalen Grenzen hinweg a seien einige der wesentlichsten Errungenschaften, avon denen gerade Asterreich massiv profitieren konnte. Wer hier anderes behauptet, der verkennt die Tatsachena, hielt Neumayer fest. So mA 1/4 ssten die Staats- und Regierungschefs jetzt die notwendigen Weichenstellungen hin zu einer fokussierteren EU vorbereiten, um so deren HandlungsfA$?higkeit nachhaltig zu stA$?rken. aGerade aus Sicht des Wirtschafts- und Industriestandortes Europa ist ein Weitermachen, wie bisher, keine Option. Damit riskiert man ein endgA 1/4 ltiges Scheitern des europA$?ischen Projektsa, gab sich Neumayer A 1/4 berzeugt. Auch die bloAe BeschrA$?nkung auf denA Binnenmarkt wA 1/4 rde den aktuellen groAen Herausforderungen nicht gerecht werden. Vielmehr benAPtige es einen differenzierten Ansatz zur Zukunft Europas. aWir brauchen ein Mehr an Europa wo notwendig a etwa im Sinne eines Voranschreitens einer Gruppe an Mitgliedstaaten a bei einer gleichzeitig intelligenten Begrenzung auf das Wesentliche. Auch wird die Dringlichkeit vieler Problem derzeit nicht geringer. Daher mA 1/4 ssen wir einen Modus fA 1/4 r raschere und effizientere Beschlussfassungen findena, betonte der IV-GeneralsekretA$?r. Auch benAPtige es in Bereichen wie der AuAen- und Sicherheitspolitik, bei grenzA 1/4 berschreitenden Investitionsprojekten, sowie bei der Absicherung der Wirtschafts- und WA$?hrungsunion eine vertiefende Integration. aNur, wenn sich Europa diesen Reformherausforderungen gemeinsam stellt, wird die EU auch weiterhin jene starke Basis fA 1/4 r Frieden, StabilitA$?t, Sicherheit und allgemeinen Wohlstand sein kAPnnen, die sie in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten immer wara, so Neumayer.

The alliance has been established to campaign in favour of European cooperation and democracy at a time when both are challenged. ALL is bringing together different sides of European society as part of a diverse and inclusive campaign in the run-up to the European Parliament elections in 2019. Through a network of national partners, ALL will endevour to offer millions of Europeans a better chance to discuss and influence politics through democratic dialogue. ALL was initiated by the European Movement International, working in partnership with the following organisations: BDI - Federation of German Industries BusinessEurope CEEP - European Centre of Employers and Enterprises providing Public Services CEMR - The Council of European Municipalities and Regions DI - Confederation of Danish Industry EEB - The European Environmental Bureau EMI - European Movement International ETUC - European Trade Union Confederation European Youth Forum IV - Federation of Austrian Industries Svenskt Naringsliv - Confederation of Swedish Enterprise Transparency International EU Markus J. Beyrer, Director General of BusinessEurope, an ALL partner, explains: \"The European Union is built on the values of democracy and freedom. BusinessEurope has supported the European project since the very beginning. There is no freedom of enterprise without free thinking and true democracy. Engaging in the debate on the future of Europe and working in partnership with ALL reflects this conviction\". Mr. Luca Vincentini, Secretary General of the European Trade Union Confederation, says he is convinced that there is a profound need for a new kind of cooperation between all sides of society to defend and strengthen the great values on which Europe is built: democracy, human rights, freedom of speech and the rule of law: \"We have joined the alliance because we want to engage our members in a debate on the future of Europe, which is open, inclusive and transcends sectoral lines and national interests.\" The Secretary General of the European Environmental Bureau, Mr. Jeremy Watts, has chosen to become a member of ALL because of the difficulties Europe is facing: \"Europe is faced with a multitude of challenges so this is the time to defend European democracy and cooperation. There is no other way than working closely together. We want to make Europe more connected and empower Europeans to take part in the debate on Europe's future\". Petros Fassoulas, Secretary General of the European Movement International, says: \"There is most certainly a need for Europeans from all walks of life to come together and stand up for democracy right now. Just a month ago, an online survey showed that fewer than half of 6,000 young people aged between 16 and 26 from seven EU countries - all home to large populist movements -- believed that democracy was the best form of government. This clearly demonstrates the need to talk with people about why Europe, and European democracy, is more needed than ever.\" He continues: \"We have come together to build a campaign that will foster democracy in action. We want to give people across Europe a chance to engage. We believe that by fostering democratic debate on the issues that matter to our fellow Europeans, we can make them part of the decisions that affect them ahead of the 2019 European Parliament elections.\" Christoph Neumayer, Director General of the Federation of Austrian Industries (IV), partner of ALL: \"Austrian industry has always been a pioneer of European integration. Especially since 1995, when Austria joined the European Union, our country has written a remarkable success story: United Europe worked und still works as driving force for more prosperity, more jobs and a higher social level. However, Europe is much more: Its core values, democracy, human rights and freedom, are the base for economic success and should be seen as a global role model. But it must be clear that we have to improve our Europe every single day - for this we need an intensified debate on the future of Europe.\" For more details (including our mission statement) please go to www.allfordemocracy.eu Aktionen: Beitrag drucken TXT Text Artikel auf Facebook teilen Artikel auf Twitter teilen Artikel-Link per E-Mail versenden Informationen zum Beitrag Schwerpunkte Zukunft der Europaischen Union Verwandte Themen Beitrage: 20 gefunden Europapolitik Industrie zu ,,60 Jahre Romische Vertrage\": EU unverzichtbar, aber reformbedurftig IV-GS Neumayer: Jetzt Weichen richtigstellen, um Handlungsfahigkeit Europas nachhaltig zu starken - Osterreich profitiert...

Belangrijke voorwaarde daarbij: economische voorspoed. Dat concludeert UT-onderzoeker Joost van den Akker in zijn proefschrift over EU-referenda, dat hij vandaag verdedigt. Photo by: Harald Richter Wat zijn de belangrijkste resultaten uit je onderzoek? 'Referenda over de EU zijn geen zeldzaamheid en ze leiden lang niet altijd tot een 'nee' van de bevolking. 46 van de 61 referenda werden gewonnen door de regering. Economische voorspoed speelt daarbij een belangrijke rol. Regeringen profiteren bij referenda over EU-onderwerpen van politieke stabiliteit en een gunstige economie. Als deze factoren afwezig zijn, is winst onwaarschijnlijk.' De regering wint driekwart van de referenda. Toch is het beeld dat de regering vaak verliest... 'Veel van de referenda gingen over de toetreding van Midden- en Oost-Europese landen tot de EU. De bevolking van deze landen koos voor het al dan niet toetreden. Dat zijn voor regeringen niet de moeilijkste referendums om te winnen. De laatste tien jaar maken burgers meer gebruik van de gelegenheid om een referendum te houden. Daar komt vaker een 'nee' uit.' Nu wil de Nederlandse regering het referendum afschaffen... 'Dat is vrij uitzonderlijk. De afschaffing van een referendum-voorziening gebeurt zelden. Sinds de jaren 90 zijn er juist meer mogelijkheden bijgekomen. Het verband tussen het afschaffen van het referendum en de eerdere uitkomsten staat letterlijk in het regeerakkoord: het referendum 'bracht niet wat ervan verwacht werd'. Ik denk dat Nederland, dat op dit gebied onervaren is, last heeft van koudwatervrees.' Wat doen regeringen als ze een 'nee' van de bevolking krijgen? 'Een voorbeeld daarvan is het Oekraine-referendum. De Nederlandse regering kwam na de uitslag met een aanvullende verklaring en probeert er een draai aan te geven. Ze moeten tegemoet komen aan de Nederlandse bevolking, maar tegelijkertijd is er de druk vanuit Brussel. Dat is een breder patroon bij 'nee'-uitslagen. Tegelijkertijd zie je bijvoorbeeld bij Denemarken en Zweden, die een referendum over de toetreding tot de Eurozone hielden, dat ze de uitslag - een 'nee' van de bevolking - gewoon accepteerden. Maar zij hadden toen geen verplichtingen aan Brussel.' En nu, een carriere in de wetenschap of toch de politiek? 'De wetenschap smaakt zeker naar meer. Er komt ook nog een hoofdstuk over het Oekraine-referendum in een handboek. Maar de komende tijd ga ik mij concentreren op mijn werk als gedeputeerde voor de provincie Limburg.'

Il presidente Trump ha chiesto agli europei di impegnarsi di piu nei finanziamenti all'Alleanza, affermando che il suo Paese non puo sostenere una parte cosi larga delle spese anche per la difesa dell'Europa. La minaccia dell'uscita degli Stati Uniti e apparsa un'enormita, anche in considerazione che la Nato (acronimo di North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Organizzazione dei Paesi che hanno aderito al Patto nord-atlantico) e stata fondata nel 1949 attorno agli americani durante la Guerra fredda, contrapposta per decenni al Patto di Varsavia di obbedienza sovietica. Dopo la caduta del Muro, il concetto strategico dell'Alleanza e stato rivisitato: la Nato garantisce la liberta e la sicurezza dei Paesi membri con un impegno politico-militare. Oggi conta ventinove Stati, tutti europei eccetto Stati Uniti e Canada. Tra i membri recenti ci sono ex partecipanti al blocco sovietico, come Bulgaria, Cechia, Slovenia, Polonia, Ungheria, Lettonia, Estonia e Lituania.

By Richard Palmer From the May 2017 Trumpet Print Edition This is a year of elections for Europe. France, Germany and possibly Italy will each hold their most important election in generations. In each of these major countries, the post-World War ii political system is crumbling. The unthinkable is now possible: France could elect a far-right president, Italy could quit the eurozone, and the European rock of stability, Germany, could convulse.Across the world, observers are watching anxiously.But one country has already held its 2017 election, and its results give us a powerful message about what to expect.Europeans Want a StrongmanThe Dutch election on March 15 exposed a major shift in European politics. Ahead of the election, many polls showed that Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (pvv) would win. \"I hate Islam\" is among one of Mr. Wilders's more controversial statements. He also wants the Koran outlawed. When he only came second, the Western media were euphoric. Bloomberg: \"Dutch Liberals Defeat Wilders's Party in Blow to Populist Surge.\" Daily Mail: \"Far-Right Dutch M.P. Geert Wilders FAILS to Make Inroads in General Election.\" The Telegraph: \"Netherlands Rejects Far Right.\"Welcome to 2017 Europe, where it is a \"major defeat\" for a far-right party to place second in a national election.A generation ago, it would have been unthinkable for someone like Geert Wilders to do so well.Wilders's influence extends far beyond those who actually voted for him. As James Traub wrote for Foreign Policy: In the weeks leading up to the vote, the Dutch have been preoccupied, almost obsessed, with issues of immigration, integration and national identity. Overschie is a largely white enclave in a city that, like most major urban centers in the Netherlands, consists about equally of immigrants and native Dutch, and everyone I spoke to in the Boulevard [a pub where the regulars are all older white men] agreed with some part of Wilders's nativist agenda. ... He has so thoroughly reshaped Dutch political culture that voters who share his views, but find him ultra vires, can now vote for any number of parties that have taken a hard-line on immigrants and on Islam, including the vvd itself. This is Europe's politics in 2017; the center holds, but only by giving ground to the nationalist right (March 13). Dutch center-right leader Mark Rutte and his People's Party for Freedom and Democracy \"won\" the elections. But the intriguing question is: How did he manage to claw ahead of Wilders in the polls?During the campaign, Rutte deliberately echoed Wilders. Immigrants must \"act normal or leave,\" he wrote. He told antisocial Turkish youths, in crass terms, to go back to Turkey. \"Everybody knows immediately this is Wilders's style. ... It's almost a dialect word, a little bit archaic,\" said Henk te Velde, a professor at Leiden University who studies political language, referring to the phrase Rutte used.Then, just a few days ahead of the election, Turkey gave Rutte a gift. Turkey is scheduled to hold a constitutional referendum on April 16 on shifting more powers to the presidency. A significant number of Turkish citizens live in the Netherlands and are eligible to vote in the referendum. So Turkish ministers scheduled rallies in the Netherlands to whip up support.The Dutch government was not keen on Turks holding rallies so close to general elections--elections in which Islam had grown to play such a key role. It tried negotiating with Turkey. During the talks, Turkey threatened to impose sanctions on the Netherlands if the latter attempted to restrict the rallies.This prompted Rutte to get tough. If Turkey was going to make threats, then no Turkish ministers would be allowed in the country, he said. The Turkish foreign minister's airplane was denied permission to land in the Netherlands.That didn't stop Turkey. Turkey's family affairs minister traveled to Germany, along with a couple of decoy ministers, to try and sneak across the border into the Netherlands. But Dutch police spotted the real minister nonetheless, and she was escorted back to Germany.As a result of this diplomatic incident, the Dutch rallied around their leader, not because he was accommodating or sophisticated, but because he was tough. According to one poll, 86 percent of the Dutch said they supported Rutte's actions. Many say that the incident occurring the weekend before the election is what boosted Rutte's popularity enough to beat Wilders. Spiegel Online wrote, \"Rutte's election win had a Turkish father: Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\"This is the path to popularity in Europe now. Stand firm for your country. Stand up to Islam. Sound like your far-right opponent.Other countries are taking note. As German business paper Handelsblatt wrote in an article titled \"Beating Populists: Lessons From the Dutch Vote\": \"Dutch prime minister and Liberals leader Mark Rutte prevailed over right-wing politician Geert Wilders thanks to statesmanship, a clear line against Turkish campaigning and by partially adopting Mr. Wilders's position on immigrants\" (March 17).The message from the election is clear: If you want to beat them, join them.It's a message Germany's conservative parties will be thinking hard about. The Alternative fur Deutschland party is not going to win Germany's general election in September. But it could siphon off enough votes from the mainstream conservative parties to cause them to lose the election.Shifting to the right, standing up to Islam, encouraging national pride--these were the paths to electoral success in the Dutch elections. And they are important trends to watch in Germany.Since its inception in 1990, the Trumpet has intently watched for the emergence of a strongman in Germany. \"Routinely in German history, when Germans become anxious about world events, they call on a strongman to lead them!\" writes Trumpet editor in chief Gerald Flurry in A Strong German Leader Is Imminent. \"They have done so throughout history--and they are going to do it again.\"\"The weakness being demonstrated by the West is exposing the crying need for stronger leadership. And whether or not people want to believe it, that leadership is going to arise in Germany,\" he writes.\"Today, Europeans are looking for another ruler like Charlemagne.\"Mr. Rutte stood up to Turkey and received the support of 86 percent of his countrymen for his handling of the issue, according to a snap poll by Maurice de Hond released days before the election. He is not this coming strongman--he is not that strong and, despite his electoral victory, received only limited support. He got a boost in support due to a single instance of standing up to Turkey. But that boost shows what Europe's voters want.It is making German political leaders think seriously about the need for strongmen to win elections.A Shattered Electoral SystemThe Dutch election also demonstrated another important pan-European trend: the breakdown of the political system.The main left-wing party in the Netherlands, the Dutch Labour Party, collapsed from 38 seats to 9. \"[I]n this election, the fight seemed to be between right and righter, with some charming alternatives to the left, and no real place for the center-left,\" wrote the European Council on Foreign Relations (March 21).Now, Dutch politics is dominated by a range of smaller parties. Wilders's pvv, the Christian Democratic Appeal and the Democrats 66 party each won about 20 seats. The Green Left and the Socialist Party each won 14. In 2012, nearly 65 percent of the vote went to the top three parties. This time, they won only 47 percent.The governing coalition must be made up of at least four separate parties. \"This year's election may give the Netherlands its most fragmented government in history,\" wrote the New York Times. \"Some political analysts believe it could take weeks or months to form a government and that the governing coalition will be fragile. In Belgium, which has a similar political system as the Netherlands, it famously took nearly a year and a half after inconclusive elections in June 2010 to form a government\" (March 15).Berlin's elections last year showed the same trend. After support for Germany's two mainstream parties fell so low that they could not even muster a majority between them, George Friedman at Geopolitical Futures wrote that \"the results of the Berlin election look like someone smashed a plate on the floor--with support for the various parties fragmenting into pieces\" (Sept. 20, 2016).This is dangerous territory, and country after country is venturing into it. The last time we were here was in the 1930s, and it was a vicious cycle. The rise of fringe parties deprived traditional parties of their usual votes. Traditional coalitions stopped working. Mainstream parties on the right and on the left created complicated coalitions to keep the fringe parties out of power. These coalitions were unstable or ineffective, and more voters decided to leave the mainstream and back the fringe parties.What we are seeing in 2017 is nothing less than the complete breakdown of the European political system.The continuation of liberal democracy is not inevitable, and in most of Europe, democratic governments are actually relatively recent. European leaders are already toying with alternative systems (read our article \"Democracy Is Dying\").This too matches the Trumpet's forecast, which is based on biblical prophecy.In A Strong German Leader Is Imminent, Mr. Flurry writes, \"Daniel 11:21 prophesies that this strong leader will come into power 'by flatteries'--probably not by votes, but through a coalition government of some kind.\"\"The Jamieson, Fausset and Brown Commentary says 'the nation shall not, by a public act, confer the kingdom on him, but he shall obtain it by artifice, 'flattering,''' writes Brad Macdonald in the same booklet. \"In other words, a deceived public, or a group of European leaders, likely invites this man into power.\"\"This soon-coming ruler could literally be called a king,\" notes Mr. Flurry. \"Even if he is not, the Bible gives him that label. When the Bible talks about a king, in most cases it's saying that this is not a democratic government.\"This breakdown in European politics is setting the stage for a leader to rise through these sorts of \"flatteries.\"This prophetic framework does not tell us exactly what will happen in the French, German and possible Italian elections. But it gives a general outline of what to expect in Europe: what trends will be important in these elections and beyond. Political systems will stall. People will become desperate for a strong leader. They will get one. Europe will form a united front. And this king will ultimately go to war with Islam and with powers beyond.This is exactly the type of leader the Trumpet has said to look for in Germany. Keep watching for him.

Oliver Sume, eco Chair of the Board has expressed the Internet industry's great disappointment at the result of the vote: \"Now platform operators will be obligated to suppress alleged copyright infringements even before publication. Upload filters are supposed to check content during upload and, if a copyright infringement is suspected, block it directly. In this way, the EU is interfering massively in the basic technical structure of the Internet and is instigating a fundamental change in the values of Internet regulation. This means a paradigm shift in the liability of providers - away from the principle 'Notice And Action' and towards a binding proactive control and censorship infrastructure.\" So far, the so-called provider privilege of the E-Commerce Directive has applied: However, this is not - as is often erroneously argued - a carte blanche, whereby operators only need to act against illegal content after they have been made aware of it. Rather, it prevents platforms from being turned into a form of private justice. The erosion of the provider privilege is in its consequences a direct attack on the freedom of opinion of all, the Association of the Internet Industry warns. \"This will result in a significant violation of constitutional principles, if in future companies rather than courts decide what we are allowed to see, hear, and read in the Internet. A European ancillary copyright will also impede the digitalization of the publication and news sector, hamper innovation, and become a competitive disadvantage for Europe for investment purposes. It will result in long-term legal uncertainty for all actors. With the reformed copyright, the technologically neutral structure of the Internet will be fundamentally changed for ever,\" says Sume. The official trilogue can now follow on from the JURI decision. One last hope is that at least 10 % of the European parliamentarians will challenge the trilogue mandate in the plenum of the European Parliament. eco - Association of the Internet Industry Lichtstrasse 43h 50825 Cologne 0221-70 00 48-0 Write a message eco - capital city office Berlin Franzosische Strasse 48 10117 Berlin 030-20 21 567-0 Write a message Subscribe to Newsletter Become a member BlockchainCloud ComputingDatacenter Expert GroupDomainsE-CommerceE-MailInternet of ThingsNetworksNew WorkOnline MarketingSecurity Legal Notice Terms of Use Privacy Policy Durch die weitere Nutzung der Seite stimmen Sie der Verwendung von Cookies zu.

On 5th July, the European Parliament rejected the proposed directive with 318 votes against and 278 votes in favour. These two camps continue to clash over the future of digital copyright and the consequences this will have for 'our Internet'. Some opponents are convinced that this is a totalitarian and state-owned control method and that it signals the end of an era we have become used to. An era of being able to freely share any content online without worrying about its copyright. On the other hand, proponents of it believe that copyright now needs to be adapted for the digital age. They are part of a long line of copyright advocates who have so far managed to adapt to new markets and technologies. We are all directly or indirectly affected by this European reform directive and before opposing it, it is important to understand all of the elements of which it is composed. Some campaigners against the reform do not hesitate to use strong arguments in their attempt to convince less informed Internet users. In order to restore a balance, let's analyse this reform by asking the right questions. What did the original directive (rejected on 5th July 2018) propose? The two really problematic sections are Articles 11 and 13. The first is related to rights for newspaper publishers and the second is about copyright enforcement by the content sharing platforms we are all familiar with (Youtube, Facebook, etc.). The article that interests us today is Article 13. Article 13 is an extension of digital level copyright and would enforce the protection of any piece of work - as it should - even on the Internet. Sell your music online So, why are opponents against this reform, which aims to put in place already existing rules? Since content sharing platforms have existed, any user can freely 'upload' protected content. In the United States, they prefer to protect the platforms, by placing them under the 'Safe Harbor' shield, rather than the authors. This term, with its reassuring connotations, says that platforms cannot be held responsible for the content uploaded by their users. For example, if someone downloads a protected piece of work, the platform is not seen to be responsible thanks to the 'Safe Harbor' shield. Applying copyright to platforms would prevent users from freely uploading protected content in the same way as, for example, we are forbidden from freely selling duplicate CDs without permission or using copyright protected photographs for such things as political campaign materials. However, in the eyes of the opponents to the proposed directive, it is the user who is important ... and not the content creator (in other words, the artist). These same opponents have an unfounded fear of a world where the Internet is fully controlled and filtered. They forget, however, that the directive is not about morality or censoring the substance of the content, it simply seeks to protect artists and pay what is owed to the intellectual owner for their effort and work ... just the same as in the 'non-digital' world. The argument that complying with the directive would involve too much investment in time or money does not carry any weight as many external companies already have powerful technologies that could fill this need. This service has already been developed and is available for use at prices that are competitive enough for anyone to use. Another fear that public opinion is voicing is that the amount of content posted online will decrease. This too is another illusion. The Internet is not going to be emptied of content overnight simply because copyright is applied to its content. Artists and holders of copyrights will continue to make their songs and other work available online and users will continue to part with their data in order to access this content. The irony of this debate is that YouTube and Facebook for example, already monitor and control what users upload while prohibiting the sharing of protected content without a valid licence. However, as MEP Virginie Roziere pointed out, the GAFAs apply their own rules in terms of content control without any supervision from third parties. This is a formidable power that deserves to be questioned. In a forum linked to the French newspaper, Le Monde, 70 artists such as Jean-Jacques Goldman and Abd Al-Malik came together to recall a fundamental principle: 'If we cannot live from our work, we creators are doomed to disappear'.

Tweet Like It Google + Linkedin Pinterest Euro US Dollar (EUR/USD) Exchange Rate Benefits From Underwhelming US Inflation Data Ahead of the weekend the Euro to US Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate recovered ground in the wake of Thursday's mixed raft of US consumer price index data. Confidence in the US Dollar (USD) weakened as April's CPI figures failed to strengthen across the board as forecast, suggesting that domestic inflationary pressure is weaker than anticipated. While this is not the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation this softness left USD exchange rates on a generally weaker footing, with policymakers still likely to be discouraged by the data. As analysts at Deutsche Bank commented: 'The details of the data showed that weakness was fairly broad based across core goods and core services with the biggest declines coming in airfares and car inflation. It's worth noting that following the average hourly earnings miss in last week's payrolls report, that now means that we've had two softer than expected US inflation prints in close succession.' After a week of strong gains, and with global geopolitical jitters easing, the appeal of the US Dollar naturally diminished. EUR/USD Exchange Rate Weakness Forecast as Eurozone Economic Growth Slows Further downside pressure may be in store for the Euro to US Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate in the coming week, however, with the release of the first quarter German and Eurozone gross domestic product data. Evidence that the currency union lost some of its economic momentum in the first three months of 2018 could weigh heavily on Euro (EUR) exchange rates. Forecasts point towards a moderate dip in both the German and Eurozone figures, suggesting that any slowing is broad-based rather than a temporary blip. This is likely to encourage the European Central Bank (ECB) to leave monetary policy on hold for the foreseeable future, pushing back the prospect of the quantitative easing programme being wound down. However, if the growth figures surprise to the upside this could spur the EUR/USD exchange rate to sharply extend its gains and reverse its recent bearish trend. US Protectionism Worries Forecast to Limit Euro US Dollar (EUR/USD) Exchange Rate Upside While US data is a little thinner on the ground next week the Euro to US Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate could still see some fresh weakness. An uptick in Tuesday's advance retail sales figures may prompt investors to pile back into the US Dollar once again. As long as signs point towards a more resilient US economy the mood of USD exchange rates is likely to remain more bullish in nature. Political developments could provoke further jitters for the EUR/USD exchange rate in the near term as the EU continues to push for a permanent exemption to US steel and aluminium tariffs. Fresh signs of protectionism from the Trump administration may encourage a resurgence in market risk aversion, to the benefit of the safe-haven US Dollar. Any increase in geopolitical tensions is likely to leave the Euro to US Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate on a weaker footing.

As today's consumers interact with brands through a variety of different touch points, the type of data being received is always changing. This makes it more important than ever for marketers to manage their customer data and maintain its integrity, validity and accuracy. In this article we discuss four ways to successfully manage your marketing data so you have a platform for making accurate and informed decisions for your business going forwards. 1. Choose your critical data The marketing world is awash with all sorts of customer data, and marketers love to collect it. But is the data you're collecting actually relevant to what the marketers want to achieve? ... Analysis / Business Why Automated Document Management Is A Vital Part Of The Data Protection Officer's Toolbox Dean McGlone March 22, 2018 No Comments 513 views As we march into 2018, most organisations are in the process of readying themselves for the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which comes into effect in May. While many are thinking of hiring dedicated a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to inform and advise them, the reality is that if you're a public authority, or process personal data on a \"large scale\", you simply won't have a choice in the matter: you must have a DPO by law. While your DPO could be recruited internally, or externally, a recent study published by the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) showed that at least 750,000 DPOs will be needed worldwide. And while exacting knowledge of the new regulation is one thing, your DPO must also have professional experience of your business, and the data pro... Analysis / Business Will GDPR Change How Startups Are Funded? Julian Saunders January 30, 2018 No Comments 461 views The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a sweeping piece of legislation that will fundamentally change how data is used, protected and controlled. It has teeth - manifested by its big fines for breaches which the ICO are indicating they intend to exercise. However, GDPR is nothing to be feared. As has been discussed at length, it is a force for good, empowering people, promoting transparency and accountability, and a mechanism to improve marketing, customer service and a host of other business processes. A little talked about aspect of GDPR is how it could change how startups raise funding. There are three areas it could impact. The first is how investors assess the risks and benefits associated with a company. Particularly, how will it collect, store, manage and use private... Analysis / Ecommerce Top 5 Ways Marketing Has Changed Through Big Data Mathias Lanni January 3, 2018 2 Comments 462 views It goes without saying that the Internet and the digital revolution have reshaped nearly every aspect of business, but one of the industries which has been most impacted is marketing. Marketing and advertising tactics went for nearly a century with only minimal revision, which led to a lot of agencies becoming a bit complacent. Then when the digital revolution hit and totally reshaped how consumers and brands interacted, most marketers were caught completely off-guard. Even now, after 10-20 years to adjust, the industry is only beginning to get its bearings again and start embracing the potential in electronic data. Understanding such trends is at least as important as a company's own data handling practices. Data must have context to be relevant or useful, and in this case, that con... Analysis / Enterprise Net Neutrality: Why It's Vital For Digital Transformation Patrick Booth December 11, 2017 No Comments 1077 views Until a few months ago, it was thought that the issue of net neutrality had been definitively settled by the ruling of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2015; however, that all changed with the new Trump administration and statements by the new FCC president - just reappointed for 4 years by the US Senate - that called net neutrality rules a \"mistake\". The FCC has since launched a process to challenge the principle of net neutrality; a move that some web users and tech companies view as a frontal attack on a basic guiding principle of the internet. There was a day of protest from the main digital platforms and many other companies. For many people, the net neutrality principle and the unrestricted flow of data fuels innovation - think YouTube, Net... Analysis / Business The Key Challenges Presented By GDPR Dan Martland November 20, 2017 No Comments 565 views Customer data is critical when building new services. Regardless of how companies and other organisations are using that data, they will all now be facing the same General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) challenge, how to mask customer data or build accurate and useable synthetic data, while retaining referential integrity for testing new products or services. The imminent arrival of the GDPR in May 2018 is bringing the testing community to the forefront of data handling practices. The penalties for non-compliance are now well known. But despite the fact that organisations accessing or processing EU-based personal information must comply with the GDPR, only 19 per cent of UK CIOs currently have plans in place to deal with it. Against this backdrop testing providers are being called upon ... Analysis / Business Harness The Power Of Data To Make A Positive Impact On Your Business Derek Munro March 9, 2015 No Comments 273 views Every year, Experian conducts a global research project to benchmark trends and interpret shifts in the data quality market. This year's report is particularly interesting as it highlights a growing trend that businesses are increasingly aware of the potential of their data. More see it as a valuable asset that they can use to harness business intelligence, and in turn get closer to their customers to provide better products, services, experiences and overall, value. Interestingly, this correlates with research we conducted last year in which CIOs stated they could increase their organisation's profit by an average of 15% if their data was of the highest quality. Those organisations who proactively manage data as an asset with a joined up approach to data quality are the ones that reap the... Analysis / Ecommerce Slow And Steady: Extract Data At A Rate Customers Are Comfortable With Chloe Basterfield February 9, 2015 No Comments 279 views Customer relationships take time to build. Yet a surprising number of marketers see the sales process more as a series of checkboxes than a development over time. Slow Is Fast: Results Take Time Take those Web enquiry forms where you hit 'Submit' ... and your phone rings two seconds later. For some customers, that's great service. For others, it's too pushy. The Sales Executive might be following the right sales process (following up a form submission with a phone call) without paying attention to the sales cycle (the average time between first contact and buying decision.) Customers only give up data - especially the big stuff like their budget and decision dates - when they're ready. If you push them too soon, or give them thin content in exchange for their private information,... Analysis / Enterprise How To Manage The Data Explosion In 2015 Izak Oosthuizen February 5, 2015 No Comments 396 views SMEs today are trying to run their IT operations, whilst facing a flood of ever increasing volumes of structured and unstructured data. With data volumes rapidly growing, 2015 will become a more challenging year than ever for businesses to effectively backup, store and access information - without experiencing significant pain and requiring costly resources. The key to successfully managing data storage, is achieving a better understanding of your information and its actual value. This will help avoid, not only the costs arising from ineffective backing up, but also data loss and compliance risks. To make this task easier, I have discussed typical data management mistakes and highlighted some practical tips and solutions. Get Data Aware As most businesses have no idea about the value... Analysis / Business Businesses Need To Deal With Paper's Invisible Footprint Phil Greenwood December 10, 2014 No Comments 260 views Last December, just as everyone was preparing to head home for the festive break, a worrying story hit the scientific research press. A team at the University of British Columbia had been attempting to collect original research data from a random set of 516 studies published between 1991 and 2011. They discovered that 80 per cent of the scientific data that informed the studies had been lost. They noticed that for the first two years after publication, data was properly filed, protected and stored. Then it started to disappear, at a rate of 17 per cent a year. Never to be found again. It is easy to convince ourselves that this couldn't happen today in our connected, backed-up, data-driven universe; but the fact is that the majority of business information still spends much, if not all of i... Analysis / Security Encrypt, Mask, Purge: A 3-Step Approach To SAP Security James Hadley November 14, 2014 No Comments 366 views Last year, PC World published an article discussing SAP security. Though SAP has consistently improved its data security, the article highlighted inconsistent security practices used by users of SAP products. For example, one expert cited in the article estimated that 5 to 10 percent of SAP users expose critical services to the Internet that ought not to be publicly accessible. These services are vulnerable to hacking. Another expert felt that those numbers were low and that many of the systems were still vulnerable to well-known exploits. The discussion then moved to the age of some SAP implementations, suggesting that age could contribute to vulnerabilities.

This is complicated further by data protection and compliance policies involving codes of conduct for IT decision makers throughout the UK. From payments to data sovereignty, there is a rule or best practice guide for everything meaning finding a place to start is challenging. Every UK organisation must comply with the regulations or they could face hefty penalties and suspension of service. Non-compliance is no longer an option. A recent survey has unearthed the fact that almost half (43%) of IT professionals don't currently understand the compliance legislation when it comes to managing data. It's no wonder why.

Erstens wA 1/4 rde Europas WettbewerbsfA$?higkeit geschmA$?lert und zweitens ist der wirtschaftliche Nutzen, den GroAbritannien aus seiner EU-Mitgliedschaft zieht, bedeutenda, so Christoph Neumayer, GeneralsekretA$?r der Industriellenvereinigung (IV) heute, Mittwoch, im Vorfeld des EuropA$?ischen Rates am 18. und 19. Februar.A Der europA$?ische Arbeitgeberverband BUSINESSEUROPE hat seine Bedenken und Hauptanliegen zu einem mAPglichen Brexit im Namen aller europA$?ischen Industrie- und ArbeitgeberverbA$?nde zudem in einem gemeinsamen Brief an EU-RatsprA$?sident Donald Tusk festgehalten. Ebenso hat die IV einen Offenen Brief des britischen Arbeitgeberverbandes CBI fA 1/4 r den Verbleib GroAbritanniens in der EuropA$?ischen Union mitunterzeichnet. Die IV bekrA$?ftige darin ihre Position, dass GroAbritannien als wichtiges EU-Mitglied in der EU bleiben soll. Neumayer: aGroAbritannien ist ein wichtiges, wirtschaftspolitisch liberal ausgerichtetes Mitglied. Eine der wichtigsten SA$?ulen der Verhandlungen A 1/4 ber seine weitere Mitgliedschaft ist, die EU wettbewerbsfA$?higer zu gestalten. Eine durchaus berechtigte Forderung, die nicht nur GroAbritannien, sondern der gesamten EU Vorteile bringen wA 1/4 rde. Europa muss Wachstum und ArbeitsplA$?tze schaffen.

Tweet Like It Google + Linkedin Pinterest Pound slumps overall as businesses step back from UK - Mounting concerns about future performance Euro climbs overall against peers - Gains come from unemployment data European Commission highlights overall confidence dip - EU Referendum cited as prime suspect German inflation rate data due shortly - UK to bring further confidence news tomorrow The Pound has been a poor option for investment of late, having echoed earlier performances by sliding against a majority of its peers on alarming national data results. The Euro has been charting an opposite course, having made respectable gains against many of its rivals on supportive unemployment results for both Germany and Spain. UK Economic News: Pound Flops on Further Evidence of 'Brexit' Jitters The Pound has been in the pits recently, having fallen by -0.7% against the Euro (GBP EUR), -0.8% against the Romanian Leu (GBP RON), -1% against the Hungarian Forint (GBP HUF) and -1.2% against the Israeli New Shekel (GBP ILS). The source of this most recent downtrend for the Pound has been business news; in the first case, Lloyds has announced hundreds of branch closures and thousands of job cuts recently, while outdoor advertiser JCDecaux has announced its intentions to cut back on investment in the UK in the wake of the EU Referendum. Adding salt to the wound has been Countrywide Plc, which has observed that: 'We saw a slowdown in our retail and London residential businesses and, since the EU referendum result this has become more marked in London, the South East and expensive prime markets'. Euro Triumphs on Trio of Supportive Post-'Brexit' Ecostats In a diametrically opposite performance to the Pound, the Euro has been in high-demand against its rivals lately, with advances including 0.3% against the Canadian Dollar (EUR CAD) and the South African Rand (EUR ZAR), along with 0.8% against the Pound (EUR GBP). This is a significant improvement on last week's movement. One of the first pieces of good news came from Spain, which has seen a Q2 unemployment rate drop to an almost 6-year low. In addition, Germany has also seen the number of unemployed persons in July fall by a larger amount than had been predicted. Continuing the trend of Eurozone support have been the results for Eurozone confidence in July; for business, services and economic sentiment, increases over previous scores have been seen, while as a clear sign of the rippling effect of the EU Referendum result, overall consumer confidence has dropped from -7.2 to -7.9. Other highlights for the Eurozone today have included rising Greek business confidence in July along with a rise in Belgium's monthly and annual July inflation rates. Future GBP, EUR Forecast: German CPI Data due Shortly, More UK Confidence Data Out in Near-Term The next economic announcements to watch out for will come from the Eurozone once again, with Germany bringing its annual and monthly preliminary inflation rate results for July in the early-afternoon. Forecasts have been for growth in both fields. From the UK, tomorrow's data will come extremely early when the pessimistically-predicted GfK consumer confidence result for July is announced. Current GBP, EUR Exchange Rates The Pound Euro (GBP EUR) exchange rate was trending in the region of 1.1868 and the Euro Pound (EUR GBP) exchange rate was trending in the region of 0.8427 today.

This has been particularly of interest for the energy sector, given that Iran possesses large reserves. The Israeli government has been strongly against the deal, fearing that an end to sanctions will jeopardize its ultimate objective or regime change in Iran. The EU is trying to keep the deal alive without the US, but is facing an uphill struggle as the US threatens to sanction European companies who continue to do business in Iran. \"The lifting of nuclear-related sanctions is an essential part of the deal,\" the EU joint statement read. The EU foreign ministers vowed to work toward \"the preservation and maintenance of effective financial channels with Iran, and the continuation of Iran's export of oil and gas.\" The statement also reiterated the EU's intention of activating a 'blocking statute' that would allow EU countries and companies to continue doing business with Iran. European investment in Iran has exploded since the nuclear deal was agreed two and a half years ago. Last month the EU foreign ministers wrote a letter to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying that persevering with the existing nuclear deal was the \"best basis on which to engage Iran\". Iran and the EU have been working together in the past months to try to find a way to shield European companies from American punishment if they continue investments. read more Climate Change & Global Warming UK Politician Amber Rudd: No Deal Brexit as Bad as Climate Denial July 30, 2018 0 Comments 13 views Guest essay by Eric Worrall Former British Secretary for Energy and Climate Change Amber Rudd, who admitted to \"inadvertently\" misleading parliament when she resigned as Home Secretary, has just conflated criticism of the British Government's Brexit proposition with \"climate denial\". Amber Rudd compares Eurosceptics to climate change deniers as she warns over 'sobering risks' of no-deal Brexit Anyone who claims Brexit will be easy is 'being as cavalier with people's future as those who deny that the belching of fossil fuels into the atmosphere is warming the planet' Lizzy Buchan Political Correspondent A former cabinet minister has compared Brexiteers to climate change deniers as she fired off a warning over the \"sobering risks\" to the economy if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. ... Writing in The Sunday Times, Ms Rudd, a former energy secretary, said: \"Yes, we will leave the EU's political institutions in March next year - we will no longer have MEPs or be members of the European Council. But disentangling regulatory and legal systems that have been entwined for more than 40 years will require delicate diplomacy. \"Such an endeavour will not be straightforward. Anyone who claims it will is being as cavalier with people's future as those who deny that the belching of fossil fuels into the atmosphere is warming the planet. \"Just as we must listen to scientific warnings about the risks of manmade climate change, so we must listen to the businesses and economists warning that a chaotic Brexit will threaten our economy.\" ...

But in my opinion Amber Rudd's attempt to conflate climate \"denial\" and criticism of the government's Brexit plans in my opinion is a desperate and rather clumsy attempt to shut down public debate. read more Conservation & Sustainability Malta's 'barbaric' finch traps ruled illegal by EU court June 21, 2018 0 Comments 19 views Malta has broken EU law by allowing the hunting and trapping of several finch species, the European court has ruled. An estimated 110,000 finches have been caught by hunters since then, along with many other wild birds such as song thrushes and golden plovers. Catherine Bearder, the Liberal Democrat MEP, hailed the verdict as \"a welcome judgment that confirms what we have all known for too long. The slaughter of these wonderful birds is illegal and unsustainable. The EU must step in and take action to stop the killing without delay.\" Finch-trapping was once common across Europe but the practice has been progressively rolled back by the EU's birds directive, which aims to conserve avian species and prevent habitat destruction. It should mark the end of indiscriminate trapping, which is a completely unsustainable and barbaric practice.\" According to BirdLife, the court verdict effectively outlaws the trapping of finches in Malta, which had been due to resume with this autumn's hunting season. Malta had reportedly argued in court that the EU's birds directive allowed it to strike a balance between conservation and leisure activities. But the judges in Luxembourg found that its derogation was not selective, did not apply merely to \"small numbers of birds\", and that more humane alternatives had not been considered. \"Trapping in Malta is so intensive that only a handful of each of the common finch species regularly breed on the islands, whereas they breed in high numbers in other areas of the Mediterranean,\" the ruling noted. Those that survive are typically sold between trappers or traded in markets and pet shops as \"domestic birds\". read more Climate Change & Global Warming EU decides on non-binding 2030 energy efficiency target June 20, 2018 0 Comments 18 views Deal between lawmakers and ministers will cut energy waste 32.5% and reduce reliance on fossil fuel imports, but didn't go far enough for green groups EU negotiators finally signed off on new energy efficiency rules Tuesday evening (19 June), as Bulgaria's EU Presidency wrapped up another clean energy file. The Council was able to defend its own red line though; namely, where energy savings should or should not actually be made. Comment: The EU needs to update its climate ambition - here's how It looked likely that the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) would mirror the renewable energy directive (RED) agreement with a '32/32' set of targets but the extra half a percentage point sets the energy savings rules apart. The RED deal is also binding rather than a mere 'headline'. Talks had started and were ongoing at the time of writing. EU negotiators meet once again this week for what promises to be final talks on two crucial energy files on energy governance and energy efficiency. But Bulgarian Presidency negotiator Zhecho Stankov insisted that his mandate was not generous enough to meet the Parliament's new negotiating position and the talks collapsed. Poche tweeted after tonight's agreement that the deal is \"strong\" on Article 7 and that the final text will guarantee \"higher annual savings\" than the European Commission's original proposal. But Europe's gas self-sufficiency dropped below 50% for the very first time as well.

Some of these items -- like plastic straws, cotton buds, plates and disposable cutlery -- will be banned completely under the new rules, which require the approval of the European Parliament and all 28 EU member states. 500,000 tonnes of EU plastic waste end up in the sea every year. We can only solve this urgent issue together. Improved waste management of abandoned and lost fishing gear, which accounts for almost 30 percent of Europe's beach litter, is also mandated in the proposal. \"Single-use plastics are not a smart economic or environmental choice, and today's proposals will help business and consumers to move towards sustainable alternatives. We can create sustainable products that the world will demand for decades to come, and extract more economic value from our precious resources.#PlasticsStrategy #PassOnPlastic pic.twitter.com/19mCvxlJOq -- European Commission (@EU_Commission) May 28, 2018 According to CNN Money, it could take three or four years for the rules to be enforced. But if they are, the European Commission said the measures are expected have a profound financial and environmental impact. \"Having one set of rules for the whole EU market will create a springboard for European companies to develop economies of scale and be more competitive in the booming global marketplace for sustainable products,\" the commission said in a press release. Plastics Europe, a trade group representing European manufacturers, criticized the proposal, saying in a press release that \"plastic product bans are not the solution\" and \"alternative products may not be more sustainable.\" read more Energy EU's Energy Chief Says 'Time Has Come' For New Russia, Ukraine Gas Talks May 23, 2018 0 Comments 21 views BRUSSELS, May 23 (Reuters) - The European Union's energy chief said on Wednesday he had reached out to Russia and Ukraine to relaunch EU-mediated talks over their gas dispute and continued gas transits via Ukraine to Europe after their contract expires in 2019. \"I have reached out to both, Ukrainian and Russian partners, and invited them for trilateral talks,\" European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said in a statement. \"The talks... should start as soon as possible in order to take stock of the gas matters important for involved parties and to look into gas transit via Ukraine beyond 2019.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow was ready for talks with Ukraine on continued gas transits through the country, following talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The EU is currently set to reduce its energy use by 20 percent by making improvements to energy efficiency and buildings. The targets cover the years 2014 to 2020, but the UK is lobbying to be allowed to count efficiency improvements made from 2010, and to carry over any improvements made over the target to count towards post-2020 commitments. \"This approach would risk failure in our efforts to reach even moderately ambitious overall targets, while the higher--and beneficial targets--that we need to strive for could become lost altogether,\" Javor said. Unlike their counterparts in the U.S., UK conservatives currently in power have rhetorically embraced global environmental action. The UK has also emerged as a leader in the global fight against ocean plastics this year, announcing in April a plan to end the sale of single-use plastics like straws and drink stirrers. But some are concerned that the government's actions won't match its words, and this move confirms those fears. \"This sneaky, behind-the-scenes amendment indicates a government that likes to pretend it is a global leader but will not take the strong policy action needed to deliver the necessary change,\" shadow international trade and climate spokesman Barry Gardiner told The Guardian. These concerns were further supported by a recent risk analysis commissioned by Friends of the Earth that found that Brexit is likely to weaken UK environmental regulations. The analysis found that a 25-year environment plan launched by May and touted by Gove was vague and less ambitious than current EU law. read more Climate Change & Global Warming Three quarters of EU climate finance goes to middle income countries: report April 23, 2018 0 Comments 30 views The Act Alliance is calling on the EU to direct more climate finance to the most vulnerable, after finding Turkey and Ukraine were the biggest beneficiaries The EU favours middle-income countries with its climate aid program, according to analysis by a coalition of development agencies. In a report released on Wednesday, the Act Alliance called on the EU to revise its climate finance strategy after finding EU institutions channeled 78% of their funding to middle income countries. Vulnerable least developed countries (LDC) received just 19%. Act Alliance spokesman Mattias Soderberg said: \"There's a lot of political will to tie Turkey and the EU together; this cooperation means a flow of funds to the region. It's very unfortunate because the funds are needed most in the poorer countries, but they're just not getting there as much.\" The study compiled climate finance accounts from the European Commission, development banks and member states. Climate change is a major driver of conflict and major catastrophes, this is highly likely to cause migration as a result of displacement,\" said Soderberg. \"Possibilities for development are at risk if we don't invest in the right places now.\" Report: Africa holds EU climate agenda ransom The EU and other developed countries have promised to collectively mobilise $100 billion of climate aid each year by 2020. Over 40% of EU climate aid is delivered as loans, which means that developing countries must repay the support that they receive. Soderberg said a loans-based funding model could undermine EU alliances with African states for upcoming climate talks in Bonn and Katowice. Currently, there is no agreement.\" Transparency of climate finance is a key issue at UN climate talks, as countries aim to agree a rulebook for implementing the Paris Agreement by the end of 2018. read more Climate Change & Global Warming Only revolutionary new laws can stop Brexit harming the environment April 3, 2018 0 Comments 32 views Under EU law, and the UK's own 2008 Climate Change Act, environmental limits have been imposed on our entire economy. The act requires government to limit the total carbon emissions of the UK to levels set in law. The Climate Change Act should now become the model for the new environmental legislation we need after Brexit The revolutionary nature of this approach has not been widely understood. The Climate Change Act effectively places the UK economy under a sustainability constraint. The UK may be only 40 years away from the near-eradication of soil fertility. The Climate Change Act should now become the model for the new environmental legislation we need after Brexit. Over time these limits should cover all the major global and domestic environmental impacts of the UK economy, including air pollution, soil degradation, resource depletion, plastics pollution and biodiversity loss. Call for post-Brexit trade deals to safeguard against invasive species Read more For each major environmental impact, the act would establish a long-term goal and require government to set shorter-term targets and plans. The goals and targets would be based on the advice of an expert and independent sustainable economy commission, modelled on the climate change commission, which would in turn report to parliament. Only by constraining it to live within the planet's limits, in law, can we ensure a sustainable future. read more Climate Change & Global Warming Documents reveal UK push to water down EU biomass regulations February 21, 2018 0 Comments 40 views The win for Whitehall's lobby offensive - in alliance with Poland and Spain - was pushed through in a ministerial revision to the renewable energy directive in December. This was because the proposal tolerated the cutting down and burning of whole trees, a process that releases more CO2 into the atmosphere than replanted trees can absorb for decades, if not centuries. Greenpeace's chief UK scientist Doug Parr told CHN: \"The UK government knows this energy source could backfire and has cooled on providing fresh subsidies, yet they are trying to lobby the EU to make it easier to burn more wood. If ministers really want Britain to be a climate leader, they should back unambiguously clean renewable technologies like solar and wind that really help tackle climate change.\" The directive still needs to be approved by the European Parliament, Commission and Council in a trilogue process that could take up to a year. But even this assumption is wildly optimistic, according to a study published in Environmental Research Letters today, which provides a new model for calculating the net emissions impact of burning wood pellets made only from residues, and not whole trees. Because burned pellets emit carbon at a faster speed than decomposing forest material, the paper finds that burning them creates more net emissions - when measured against their \"alternative fate\" as decomposing twigs and branches. Wood burning power plants account for the majority of Europe's renewable energy production and are as eligible for renewable energy subsidies as wind or solar power. The pellets they burn are often made from felled whole trees, but the paper finds that even when \"true\" wood wastes are assumed, up to 95% of the cumulative pollution represents a net addition to the atmosphere over decades. \"Drax and other power plants burning wood pellets emit as much or more CO2 per megawatt-hour as when they burn coal, but they get to avoid carbon trading fees for biomass emissions,\" Booth said. Drax's biomass units deliver carbon savings of more than 80% compared to when they used coal - this is independently audited.\" A separate study released by the International Renewable Energy Association and European Commission on Monday found that the EU could cost-effectively double its deployment of biomass by 2030. read more 1 2 3 4 Next Page Follow Us!

By Dave Brown -- Exclusive to Gold Investing News The price of gold declined this week following a drop in the euro and a rate decision from the European Central Bank. The week also included increased yields at a debt auction, which created apprehension regarding Spain's financial solvency. Falling over the course of the week, spot market gold prices were trading in the range of $1,634.80 per troy ounce. This represents a decline of about 1.5 percent. In the United States, about 365,000 individuals filed initial claims for jobless benefits, a considerable drop from the 392,000 claims filed last week and ahead of consensus forecasts of 375,000. Jobless claims are widely thought to be a proxy metric for the overall job market, and generally strongly correlate with the number of layoffs in the economy. For investors, a positive result for the US employment market on Friday will likely restrain further speculation that the Federal Reserve will initiate additional quantitative easing, a prospect that is considered a catalyst for gold appreciation. Supply concerns could support gold price growth Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer for Close Brothers Asset Management, discussed gold price volatility with CNBC, commenting, \"if you look at the gold market a lot of the speculative interest has come out. It is actually basing quite nicely. We would like to see a close over $1,690 [per troy ounce] to begin to indicate a more positive trend. All these earnings [reports] indicate production problems. Production problems mean less gold on the market. Less gold on the market is supportive of the gold price.\" Company news Barrick Gold Corp. (TSX:ABX) reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, slightly below consensus estimates of $1.11. The company benefited from a 22 percent increase in gold prices as well as better copper sales. Barrick is reviewing cost estimates for its $5 billion Pascua-Lama gold and silver project on the border of Chile and Argentina because of inflationary impacts on labor and materials. On a positive note, Barrick raised its dividend by 33 percent to $0.80 per year and maintained its full-year guidance of between 7.3 million and 7.8 million troy ounces of gold and between 550 million and 600 million pounds of copper. Yamana Gold Inc. (TSX:YRI,NYSE:AUY) announced its first quarter results, which included adjusted earnings of $0.25 per share. Top line revenue increased 18 percent to $560 million from $476 million during the first quarter of last year. Yamana anticipates production targets for the year to be in the range of 1.2 million to 1.3 million gold equivalent ounces, a 13 percent increase from last year. Goldcorp Inc. (TSX:G,NYSE:GG) suspended construction of the El Morro gold and copper mine following the rejection of the $3.9 billion project's environmental permit by Chile's Supreme Court. Earlier in the spring the company indicated that it would continue developing the project unless Chile's Supreme Court upheld a decision by the Antofagasta Court of Appeals. Non-construction work on the project is expected to continue. Newmont Mining Corp. (TSX:NMC,NYSE:NEM) may have to raise the $4.8 billion budget for its Conga project in Peru after political opposition. Newmont is currently in the process of evaluating the project's economics with the potential to redistribute capital resources to other development alternatives in Nevada, Australia, Ghana, and Indonesia. Investors will be interested in these developments as escalating costs could indicate that producers will be reassessing additional proposed projects with more careful consideration. Such attention could impact exploration budgets and merger and acquisition activity. Junior company news Angkor Gold Corp. (TSXV:ANK) entered into an agreement to acquire exclusive ownership of a new concession, Andong Meas, in Cambodia. Calico Resources Corp. (TSXV:CKB) finalized plans for its 2012 exploration program at its Grassy Mountain project and expects to test additional gold occurrences on the claim group. Northern Vertex Mining Corp. (TSXV:NEE;OTCQX:NHVCF) added a second diamond drill rig to its current program at its Lemhi gold project and is waiting for the first round of results from its initial phase of drilling.
