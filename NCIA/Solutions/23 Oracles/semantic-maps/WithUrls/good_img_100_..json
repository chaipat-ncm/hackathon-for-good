The meeting produced an unusual joint declaration.CreditCreditPool photo by Ng Han GuanBySteven Erlanger and Jane PerlezJuly 18, 2018Yue Du Jian Ti Zhong Wen Ban Yue Du Fan Ti Zhong Wen Ban BRUSSELS -- From trade to regulation to security, America's traditional allies are accelerating their efforts to buttress a global system that President Trump has seemed prepared to tear down.After months of stunned indecision, they have undertaken a flurry of efforts intended to preserve the rules-based order the United States created after World War II and championed ever since.The most obvious example came on Monday, the same day a stunned world watched Mr. Trump praise President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a competitor after having dismissed Europe as an economic \"foe.\" A few thousand miles away, in Beijing, the leaders of the European Union and China held a long-scheduled meeting of their own.In the past, expectations for such meetings were low, given the conflicts on trade and human rights between the Europeans and the Chinese. But while those differences remain, this summit meeting produced an unusual joint declaration and a common commitment to keep the global system strong.The next day, the Europeans traveled to Japan and signed the biggest free-trade agreement in history, just the sort of deal the Trump administration has criticized.And on Wednesday, Europe's top regulator announced a $5.1 billion fine against Google, another strong indication that Brussels is not just fighting to maintain the rules-based trading order, but is also positioning itself as the watchdog of that system.After months of denial, anger, bargaining and depression, Europe and other parts of the world have accepted that Mr. Trump and his mission of disruption are not going away.Both France and Germany have started study groups on how to deal with the United States under Mr. Trump and how to find areas of leverage, especially on trade. The European Union is preparing whopping tariffs to counter Mr. Trump if he imposes \"national security\" tariffs on cars, a big issue for Germany.The European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, goes to Washington on July 25 to discuss the budding trade war.\"The one thing you could say in Trump's favor is, he's brought the world together on trade,\" said Jeffrey Wilson, the head of research at the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia.\"It's Trump versus the world,\" he said. \"Rather than all the other countries getting into trade disputes with each other, what's happening is there is a surprising amount of cooperation and comity.\"There are caveats, of course. The United States remains the world's leading economic and military power, and the Europeans in particular hope that Mr. Trump's successor will eventually return to embrace the global system. Europe still harbors considerable ambivalence about getting too close to China, which talks more about open trade than it actually practices.ImageThe Aomi International Container Terminal in Tokyo. Japan and the European Union signed the biggest free trade agreement in history on Tuesday.CreditKimimasa Mayama/EPA, via ShutterstockAnd the Europeans are unwilling to single out the United States as a villain -- in large part because they agree with Mr. Trump's complaints about China's predatory behavior and would rather join with Washington to alter Beijing's practices. But that route seems closed by Mr. Trump's unilateral trade warfare.So for now, the Europeans and others are making contingency plans. More than that, the language of pushback against Washington is strong and striking.The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told the Europeans that both sides should \"join hands to defend multilateralism and a rules-based free-trade system,\" echoing comments he made at Davos in January 2017, before Mr. Trump started imposing tariffs.The European Council president, Donald Tusk, said that \"it is the common duty of Europe and China, but also America and Russia, not to destroy this order but to improve it.\" That duty is not simply to shun trade wars, he said, \"but to bravely and responsibly reform the rules-based international order.\"Mr. Tusk added: \"There is still time to prevent conflict and chaos.\"But the absence of American participation has for now set off a scramble for alternative partners.The European Union-Japan trade agreement, for instance, was accelerated last year when Mr. Trump abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal President Barack Obama and the Japanese intended as a bulwark against China.The European Union and China are not natural allies on trade. The Europeans, unlike the Trump administration, continue to push China on human rights violations. And in the past two years, in the face of Chinese investment, the Europeans have become much more critical of China's industrial espionage, its cavalier attitude toward intellectual property and its ambitions to overtake the West in advanced technologies.China has used special summit meetings with European Union members and aspirants, especially those in Central Europe and the Balkans, to push strategic infrastructure investments -- creating obligations and debt that could undermine the bloc's unity.European businesses have also grown disenchanted with the difficulties of operating in China, particularly rules about data retention and the presence of Communist Party units in workplaces.Still, both the European Union and China have benefited from the rules-based order Mr. Trump has challenged. So, oddly, he has given them reason to bridge their differences. China, in particular, is looking to Europe to help shore up the World Trade Organization so it can fend off a serious trade war with the United States.Mr. Trump's threats on Chinese exports have alarmed Beijing, said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.Beijing is making every effort to avoid publicly escalating its trade dispute with America, the council has said, but it is also rediscovering the merits of greater engagement with Europe. Chinese authorities, in particular, have sought to demonstrate to Europe that economic reforms are coming.Simon Fraser, a former top British diplomat now with the management consultancy Flint Global, said that European trade officials remained frustrated with China.ImagePresident Trump at the NATO summit meeting in Brussels last week. Mr. Trump has called the Europeans an economic \"foe.\"CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times\"Trump has a point on China trade, and we want to work with the U.S. on this in the W.T.O., but we can't because Trump is slapping tariffs on us,\" he said. \"Europe is being pushed into a trade war no one wants, and again Trump has a good idea, but is going about it the wrong way.\"That was why this European Union-China summit was so important, after two years of meetings when the two sides could not even agree on a symbolic joint communique, said Theresa Fallon, director of the Center for Russia Europe Asia Studies, a research institution in Brussels.With China muting some of the demands of previous summit meetings -- primarily that Europe grant it \"market economy\" status -- the Europeans found more agreement with Beijing than in the past, while carefully keeping a distance.\"The European Union and China found some common ground at their summit, but even with Trump in the White House, the Europeans are mindful of the alliance with the United States of more than 50 years,\" said Jorg Wuttke, the former head of the European Chamber of Commerce in China. \"Common ground was found without changing sides.\"The communique mentioned the need for Chinese transparency and open markets, and the Europeans acknowledged the value of China's global infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative, without exactly endorsing it. The statement listed numerous infrastructure projects on which the two sides could cooperate.That was a considerable concession, Ms. Fallon said, given that 27 European Union ambassadors (all except Hungary's) signed a letter in April refusing to support Belt and Road because of its lack of transparency, lack of environmental protection and failure to provide a level playing field.The Europeans and Chinese also agreed to work on a bilateral investment treaty, another European concession.It was a dramatic change from the summit meeting of a year ago, noted Mr. Leonard. \"Last year was particularly grotesque,\" he said. \"Xi Jinping told Davos he was a champion of multilateralism and then refused to sign a joint statement with the European Union unless it granted China market economy status. But now that China finds itself under pressure, it is keen to have a common statement.\"China is taking steps to show it is more open to foreign investment, including approving a $10 billion petrochemicals project by Germany's BASF that does not require the joint venture structure typical of foreign investment. Ms. Fallon called it a favorable deal \"symbolic of the importance to China of Germany,\" about which Mr. Trump seems to have a special animus.However unlikely China and the European Union are to form a common front against Washington, both sides showed a willingness to compromise on the communique at a time Mr. Trump has waged his attacks.That is also true of the Japan-European Union trade deal, which cuts customs duties on European wine and cheese in exchange for gradually lowered tariffs on Japanese cars.For Japan, the deal represented a clear hedge against Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on Japanese cars, but it also gave Europe the kind of access to Japanese agricultural markets that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have granted to the United States if it had joined.For the European Union, a positive summit with China and a clear statement about cooperation to reform the W.T.O. and against unilateralism \"is clearly pointed at the United States,\" Ms. Fallon said.\"The Europeans want to show that we have other options -- and the trade deal with Japan is another display that we have other options.\"Steven Erlanger reported from Brussels, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.

Kjo eshte ajo qe mesohet nga burime te ndryshme diplomatike. Presidenti i Shteteve te Bashkuara kishte shpresuar qe vendet e Aleances se Atlantikut te rritnin prodhimin e tyre te mbrojtjes ne 4% te PBB-se. Deklaratat e miliarderit e nxiten NATO-n te therriste nje mbledhje te jashtezakonshme. Gjate fjales se tij ne sesionin e punes te dedikuar per marredheniet midis NATO-s dhe Ukraines, Trump u kthye per te sulmuar Gjermanine dhe u kthye tek partneret e tjere me tone me te ashpra sesa ato te perdorura te merkuren. Pas deklaratave te Trumpit, 29 anetaret e aleances jane ulur ne nje takim te posacem ne Bruksel. Nese Trump e ka seriozisht me kete kercenim, ende nuk dihet. Teorikisht mendohet nje reduktim i angazhimit te SHBA ne NATO, ne rastin me ekstrem edhe prishja e plote, terheqja e amerikaneve nga aleanca transatlantike. Ne samit Gjermania ka refuzuar te beje premtime te gjera per rritjen e shpenzimeve te mbrojtjes. Qeveria gjermane kerkon te jape vetem 1,5% te prodhimit te brendshem bruto per mbrojtjen deri ne vitin 2024. Kjo eshte per Trumpin teresisht e pamjaftueshme. Ai ankohet per nje shperndarje te padrejte te barres ne aleance. Sipas prognozave vetem Greqia, Polonia, Rumania, e Lituania, Letonia, Estonia do te arrijne plotesimin e kriterit per shpenzime 2% per mbrojtjen ne vitin 2018. a.s/dita .mobilediabetics{ display:none; } @media only screen and (max-device-width: 760px) { .mobilediabetics{ display:block; } } Media Sociale Ndaje me miqte Printoje Nise me e-mail July 12, 2018 13:43 Komento 2 Komente Arben July 12, 13:53 MIRE E KE SHOKU, PO DO TE DUHET TE NDAHEN EDHE PERFITIMET NE MENYRE TE DREJTE, PASTAJ.

Putin of Russia.CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times ByJulie Hirschfeld Davis and Katie Rogers July 12, 2018 BRUSSELS -- After two days of haphazard deal making with European allies over military spending and throwing some of his closest diplomatic relationships into disarray, President Trump pledged on Thursday that the United States commitment to NATO \"remains very strong\" and that his allies had agreed to increase levels of military spending \"like they never have before.\" Mr. Trump, speaking at an impromptu news conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels after he ignited a crisis behind closed doors over burden-sharing within the alliance, dismissed any concern that his relationship with Russia was too cozy or that his approach to his allies was too harsh. Hailing himself, again, as a \"stable genius,\" he took \"total credit\" for persuading his allies to increase military spending beyond established markers -- a claim that was nearly immediately undercut by at least one European leader. Mr. Trump spoke for more than a half-hour while flanked by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, his national security adviser. \"I told people I'd be very unhappy if they didn't up their commitments very substantially,\" said Mr. Trump, who has not held a news conference in the United States in more than a year. NATO officials had no immediate comment. Mr. Trump griped that the United States shouldered \"probably 90 percent of the cost of NATO\" -- the number is actually closer to 67 percent of all NATO military spending, but that includes global spending, not just Europe. The United States pays 22 percent of the NATO budget itself. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, of the $603 billion the United States spends on defense, only about $31 billion goes to Europe. NATO members have pledged to aim to spend at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on military spending by 2024, but Mr. Trump, after berating alliance countries for failing to meet a target that they were not obligated to meet for six more years, then abruptly said last night the figure should be 4 percent of G.D.P. That, he said, was closer to the correct number. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said that the meetings were \"active and demanding,\" but he rejected Mr. Trump's assertion that the NATO allies had agreed to anything that wasn't already in place. \"A communique was issued yesterday,\" Mr. Macron said. \"This communique is clear. It reaffirms the 2 percent by 2024 commitments. That's all.\" He added that the meeting ended with a stronger alliance because of Mr. Trump's reaffirmation of his commitment to it Asked whether Mr. Trump had threatened to leave NATO, Mr. Macron said, \"Generally, I do not comment on what goes on behind the scenes, but at no moment did President Trump -- neither bilaterally nor multilaterally -- say that he was intending to leave NATO.\" Mr. Trump also answered several questions about his meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, scheduled for Monday in Helsinki, Finland. The president said he would discuss violations to a treaty on nuclear weapons, as well as possibly stopping military exercises in the Baltics, but he evaded a question about whether he would recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Instead, he blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the annexation, adding that he could not say what would happen. \"Long before I got here,\" Mr. Trump said, \"President Obama allowed that to happen. That was on his watch, not on my watch.\" Mr. Trump said that, after a weekend in Scotland at Turnberry -- a golf course and Trump business that he plugged in the news conference as \"magical\" -- he would go \"to a pretty hot spot\" to meet with Mr. Putin. Asked to characterize his relationship with the Russian president, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Putin as a \"competitor,\" not an enemy, adversary or friend, and tried to wave off expectations that the \"loose meeting\" with the Russian president would result in a substantive policy outcome. \"It could lead to something very productive,\" Mr. Trump said, \"and maybe it's not.\" When asked if Russia presented a security threat, Mr. Trump offered a grudging compliment: \"Hey. I don't want him to be. And I guess that's why we have NATO.\" The unexpected news conference came after a relatively calm reception and dinner Wednesday evening and a hectic morning in which allies gave skeptical interviews to the news media about Mr. Trump's intentions. For his part, Mr. Trump showed up to the second day of the NATO summit meeting about 30 minutes behind schedule. But he found time to send two fiery tweets over what he regards as lackluster military by the United States' closest allies, and what he perceived to be an uncomfortably close financial relationship between Russia and Germany. In the news conference, Mr. Trump reiterated his frustration with Germany having agreed to a $10 billion pipeline that it approved to bring natural gas directly from Russia. In a pair of tweets sent before he arrived, he assailed the richest country in Europe. \"Not acceptable! All NATO Nations must meet their 2% commitment, and that must ultimately go to 4%!\" In front of reporters, Mr. Trump repeatedly cited the pipeline as a major point of contention with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and said that he was the \"only one\" to bring up the issue. \"We have to figure out what's going on with the pipeline,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I brought it up, nobody brought it up but me.\" That is not true: Concerns with the pipeline date back to the Obama administration.

Even as he declared that the American dedication to the trans-Atlantic alliance \"remains very strong\" forward of his summit assembly subsequent week with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, he persevered to assail shut companions and extra pressure diplomatic family members. In the last hours of the two-day accumulating in Brussels with leaders of the opposite NATO international locations, he pressured a final minute emergency assembly to deal with his grievances over spending. Then he known as a information convention to assert credit score for having careworn NATO individuals to spice up their protection budgets \"like they never have before.\" That declare was once temporarily disregarded via the leaders of each Italy and France, who disputed that they'd made any new pledges for boosting spending, including to the sense of disarray. Through all of it, conceivable threats from Russia -- and NATO's plans to stay it in take a look at -- hung over the summit assembly, as fears in Europe have risen over Mr. Putin's expanding assertiveness. On Thursday, Mr. Trump disregarded considerations that his dating with Russia was once too comfortable, or that his hardball ways at NATO had performed into the arms of Mr. Putin, whom he's to satisfy in Helsinki, Finland, subsequent week. But after 48 hours of overt warfare with allies -- and the second one world summit in two months the place he has sparred brazenly with European leaders -- he stated he regarded ahead to a good stumble upon with the Russian president. \"I hope that we're going to be able to get along with Russia; I think that we probably will be able to,\" Mr. Trump stated. \"We go into that meeting not looking for so much.\" The White House all of a sudden known as the scoop convention amid experiences that Mr. Trump had unleashed a tirade at a closed-door morning assembly towards member international locations he complained had been nonetheless no longer spending sufficient on their militaries. Mr. Trump used the scoop convention to hail himself, once more, as a \"stable genius,\" announcing he deserved \"total credit\" for pushing the allies to extend their army spending via greater than up to now agreed to. According to an individual briefed at the assembly, Mr. Trump advised different NATO leaders that if their international locations didn't meet the two % usual via January, the United States \"would go it alone,\" a remark that some interpreted as a danger to withdraw from the alliance. (Other information experiences quoted diplomats who stated the president used reasonably other wording -- announcing that he would \"do my own thing,\" -- but he was once no longer particular about what he intended in both case.) The contentious consultation triggered NATO leaders to convene a closed-door emergency consultation to talk about burden sharing throughout the alliance, and Mr. Trump emerged on the information convention to claim himself the victor. Mr. Trump sidestepped questions on whether or not he had threatened to all of a sudden depart the alliance, and stated, \"I think I probably can, but that's unnecessary,\" as a result of, he stated, member international locations \"have stepped up today like they've never stepped up before.\" \"The United States was not being treated fairly, but now we are,\" Mr. Trump stated. \"I believe in NATO. I think NATO's a very important -- probably the greatest ever done.\" But Mr. Trump then temporarily grew to become to announcing that the United States shouldered \"probably 90 percent of the cost of NATO.\" American contributions in fact constitute about 67 % of all army expenditures via alliance individuals. The United States can pay 22 % of NATO's price range, which covers such things as places of work, salaries and a few apparatus utilized in joint operations. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, of the $603 billion that the United States spends at the army each and every 12 months, about $31 billion is going to Europe. NATO individuals have pledged to dedicate a minimum of 2 % of gross home product to army spending via 2024. But Mr. Trump, after berating alliance international locations for failing to satisfy a goal this is six years away, then all of a sudden stated Wednesday that they should accomplish that in an instant, and the determine must actually be four %. As Mr. Trump boarded Air Force One and flew to London for the following leg of his European commute, he left allies suffering to provide an explanation for what had transpired. President Emmanuel Macron of France stated that the conferences had been \"active and demanding,\" but he rejected Mr. Trump's statement that the NATO member international locations had agreed to anything else that was once no longer already in position. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy sounded a identical theme. \"A communique was issued yesterday,\" Mr. Macron stated. \"This communique is clear. It reaffirms the 2 percent by 2024 commitments. That's all.\" Mr. Conte stated, \"Italy inherited spending commitments to NATO, commitments that we did not change, so no increase in spending.\" Mr. Macron added that the assembly ended with a more potent alliance on account of Mr. Trump's reaffirmation of his dedication to it. Asked whether or not Mr. Trump had threatened to depart NATO, Mr. Macron stated, \"Generally, I do not comment on what goes on behind the scenes, but at no moment did President Trump -- neither bilaterally nor multilaterally -- say that he was intending to leave NATO.\" Mr. Trump himself stated, \"It all came together at the end, and yes, it was a little tough for a little while.\" He added, \"But ultimately, you can ask anybody at that meeting, they're really liking what happened over the last two days.\" Buoyed via what he thought to be to be his achievements at NATO, Mr. Trump additionally previewed his plans for his assembly with Mr. Putin. He stated he would talk about the extension of 1 nuclear hands keep an eye on treaty and violations of every other, and would possibly broach the subject of in all probability preventing army workout routines within the Baltics, a function of Mr. Putin's. He avoided a query about whether or not he would acknowledge Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Instead, he blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the annexation, announcing, \"President Obama allowed that to happen. That was on his watch, not on my watch.\" Mr. Trump stated that, after a weekend in Scotland at Turnberry -- a golfing direction and Trump industry that he plugged within the information convention as \"magical\" -- he would cross \"to a pretty hot spot\" to satisfy with Mr. Putin. Asked to symbolize his dating with the Russian president, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Putin as a \"competitor,\" no longer an enemy, adversary or pal, and attempted to wave off expectancies that the \"loose meeting\" with the Russian president would lead to a substantive coverage end result. \"It could lead to something very productive,\" Mr. Trump stated, \"and maybe it's not.\" When requested if Mr. Putin introduced a safety danger, Mr. Trump introduced a grudging praise: \"Hey, I don't want him to be.

Even as he declared that the American commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance \"remains very strong\" ahead of his summit meeting next week with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, he continued to assail close partners and further strain diplomatic relations. In the closing hours of the two-day gathering in Brussels with leaders of the other NATO nations, he forced a last minute emergency meeting to address his grievances over spending. Then he called a news conference to claim credit for having pressured NATO members to boost their defense budgets \"like they never have before.\" That claim was quickly dismissed by the leaders of both Italy and France, who disputed that they had made any new pledges for boosting spending, adding to the sense of disarray. Through it all, possible threats from Russia -- and NATO's plans to keep it in check -- hung over the summit meeting, as fears in Europe have risen over Mr. Putin's increasing assertiveness. On Thursday, Mr. Trump dismissed concerns that his relationship with Russia was too cozy, or that his hardball tactics at NATO had played into the hands of Mr. Putin, whom he is to meet in Helsinki, Finland, next week. But after 48 hours of overt conflict with allies -- and the second international summit in two months where he has sparred openly with European leaders -- he said he looked forward to a positive encounter with the Russian president. \"I hope that we're going to be able to get along with Russia; I think that we probably will be able to,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We go into that meeting not looking for so much.\" The White House hastily called the news conference amid reports that Mr. Trump had unleashed a tirade at a closed-door morning meeting against member countries he complained were still not spending enough on their militaries. Mr. Trump used the news conference to hail himself, again, as a \"stable genius,\" saying he deserved \"total credit\" for pushing the allies to increase their military spending by more than previously agreed to.

The contentious session prompted NATO leaders to convene a closed-door emergency session to discuss burden sharing within the alliance, and Mr. Trump emerged at the news conference to declare himself the victor. Mr. Trump sidestepped questions about whether he had threatened to abruptly leave the alliance, and said, \"I think I probably can, but that's unnecessary,\" because, he said, member countries \"have stepped up today like they've never stepped up before.\" \"The United States was not being treated fairly, but now we are,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I believe in NATO.

NATO members have pledged to devote at least 2 percent of gross domestic product to military spending by 2024.

According to a person briefed on Mr. Trump's meeting with other NATO leaders, Mr. Trump said that if the other countries did not meet the 2 percent standard by January, the United States \"would go it alone.\" What that would mean was not clear to the officials who were present, but it prompted fears in diplomatic circles about the future of the alliance. White House officials did not immediately respond to requests to explain Mr. Trump's comment or to say whether \"go it alone\" was a threat that the United States could withdraw from NATO. The allies had agreed to spend 2 percent of gross national product on defense by 2024, but Mr. Trump has demanded that they meet that threshold right away. \"What they're doing is spending at a much faster clip, they're going up to the 2 percent level,\" he said, adding that he had told his counterparts the day before that \"we should be at 4 percent.\" \"The additional money that they're willing to put up has been really amazing,\" Mr. Trump said, but he said nothing about a timetable or amounts. \"Yesterday I let them know that I was extremely unhappy with what was happening and they have substantially upped their commitment.\" Mr. Trump has not held a news conference on American soil for more than a year. But on Thursday, flanked by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, his national security adviser, took questions from reporters for over a half an hour. He dismissed any concern that his relationship with Russia was too cozy or that his relationship with allies was too harsh, despite his statements questioning the value of NATO and castigating its members. There was \"great, very collegial spirit in that room,\" he said. Mr. Trump once again hailed himself as a \"very stable genius\" and took \"total credit\" for persuading his allies to increase military spending. And he took credit for other NATO countries having increased their military spending by $33 billion in the last year. \"I don't think that's helping Russia,\" he said. \"I think NATO is much stronger now than it was two days ago.\" Mr. Trump threw the meeting into turmoil on Thursday by using a session on Ukraine and Georgia, countries partially occupied by Russia, as another chance to complain about NATO military spending. That prompted the leaders to convene an emergency budget session. -- Katie Rogers, Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Steven Erlanger Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich NATO Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2018 A Russian gas pipeline to Germany is a big problem, Trump says At his news conference and on Twitter, Mr. Trump returned repeatedly to the topic of the $10 billion Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline being built to take Russian natural gas to Germany. He said on Wednesday that Germany was \"captive\" to Russia because of its dependence on Russian gas. While Germany pays billions of dollars a year for Russian energy, he said, the United States spends billions to protect Germany from Russia. \"We have to figure out what's going on with the pipeline,\" Mr. Trump said on Thursday. \"I brought it up, nobody brought it up but me.\" In fact, concerns with the pipeline date back to the Obama administration. \"Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich NATO Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia,\" Mr. Trump said on Twitter before arriving for meetings, repeating gripes he aired on Wednesday. \"They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!\" \"We have to figure out what's going on with the pipeline,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I brought it up, nobody brought it up but me.\" That is not true: Concerns with the pipeline date back to the Obama administration. -- Katie Rogers and Julie Hirschfeld Davis Trump signs a NATO declaration at odds with his own statements Source link Tags:callsstrongTrumpupdates share 0 0 0 0 Previous : Trump Reaffirms NATO Ties, and Dismisses Concerns About Russia Next : Weight loss: The ONE diet plan you will stick to - best plans revealed About The Author Peps Media Related posts What the midterms (and past elections) show about US democracy | USA News November 17, 2018 Melania Trump flexes her muscles in the White House with Mira Ricardel ouster - National November 17, 2018 Former Madagascar leaders head to election run-off | Madagascar News November 17, 2018 Leave a Reply Cancel ReplyYou must be logged in to post a comment.

Putin of Russia.CreditCreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesBySteven Erlanger, Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Katie RogersJuly 12, 2018BRUSSELS a NATO, a pillar of the global order, emerged from a two-day confrontation with President Trump on Thursday intact but distracted and shaken, a further challenge to the alliance as it faces an expansionist Russia and growing authoritarianism among some of its own members.Wrapping up talks with fellow leaders of the 29-nation trans-Atlantic alliance, Mr. Trump reaffirmed support for NATO, but only after stirring more discord with a vague threat that the United States could go its own way if the allies resisted his demands for additional military spending, capping a summit meeting punctuated by his escalating complaints.Hours later, after landing in Britain, the assault on diplomatic norms continued. In an interview with the newspaper The Sun, published late Thursday, he undercut Prime Minister Theresa May on several fronts on her own turf.In the midst of a week that has seen Mrs. May parrying threats to her hold on power, Mr. Trump criticized her strategy on cutting ties to the European Union, cast doubt on whether he was willing to negotiate a new trade deal between Britain and the United States and praised Mrs. Mayas Conservative party rival, Boris Johnson, who resigned this week as foreign secretary, as a potentially great prime minister.The entire day, from Brussels to London, was one unsettling experience after another for members of the Western alliance.Mixing pique, self-congratulation and a relentless focus on whether the United States is being taken advantage of by its closest allies, Mr. Trump spent his final hours at the NATO meeting in Brussels bludgeoning other leaders but got little in the way of concrete results.In the latest example of his penchant for creating conflict to draw attention to his agenda, he first demanded an emergency meeting to address his grievances and then called a news conference a something he has not done in the United States in more than a year a to claim atotal credita for having pressed NATO members into increasing their military budgets alike they never have before.aIt was a classic Trump performance a bluster, confrontation and demands followed by a unilateral declaration of victory a but his claim was quickly dismissed by the leaders of Italy and France, who disputed that they had made any new pledges for increasing spending, adding to the sense of disarray.His willingness to criticize Mrs. May in her own country only underscored the tensions in his relations with other allied leaders and his unconventional approach to diplomacy.But the NATO summit meeting did produce some substantive accomplishments for those who support the allianceas traditional focus on maintaining security against Russia. The leaders, including Mr. Trump, had signed on to a statement a issued after the first day of the meeting rather than at its conclusion, reducing the chances that the president might change his mind about it a that highlighted agreement on a plan to improve the readiness and mobility of the armed forces across the Continent and progress on issues like cybersecurity. And they agreed on tough language aimed at Moscow, especially regarding Russiaas annexation of Crimea.But with Mr. Trump scheduled to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday a and with the Trump campaignas ties to Russia the focus of a wide-ranging investigation a the gathering of the leaders was dominated not by discussion over how to address security threats or Mr. Putinas efforts to divide the West but by wrangling over money.Rather than projecting unity ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting, the gathering generated nonstop images of division. Intense concern about the corrosive effects of populism and growing authoritarianism in NATO members like Turkey, Hungary and Poland on support for post-World War II institutions and policies received little or no sustained public attention.In the weeks before the summit meeting, alliance leaders feared that Mr. Trump would try to blow everything up, dealing a truly severe blow to the multilateral world order and to trans-Atlantic deterrence and cohesion.On Thursday, Mr. Trump dismissed concerns that his relationship with Russia was too cozy, or that his hardball tactics at NATO had played into the hands of Mr. Putin, whom he is to meet in Helsinki, Finland, next week. But after 48 hours of overt conflict with allies a and the second international summit meeting in two months where he has sparred openly with European leaders a he said he looked forward to a positive encounter with the Russian president.aI hope that weare going to be able to get along with Russia; I think that we probably will be able to,a Mr. Trump said. aWe go into that meeting not looking for so much.aThe White House hastily called the news conference in Brussels amid reports that Mr. Trump had unleashed a tirade during a closed-door morning meeting against member countries he complained were still not spending enough on their militaries. Mr. Trump used the news conference to hail himself, again, as a astable genius,a saying he deserved atotal credita for pushing the allies to increase their military spending by more than previously agreed to.According to a person briefed on the meeting, Mr. Trump told other NATO leaders that if their countries did not meet the 2 percent standard by January, the United States would go it alone, a comment that some interpreted as a threat to withdraw from the alliance.White House officials ignored requests to clarify what the president had said or offer any information on which the allies had responded to his threats with promises of more military spending.In the end, though, he spoke supportively of the alliance, saying: aI believe in NATO. I think NATOas a very important a probably the greatest ever done.aPresident Emmanuel Macron of France said, aWe are all leaving this summit stronger because the president of the United States of America reaffirmed his commitment and his desire to have a strong NATO.aBut the leaders were clearly taken aback by Mr. Trumpas disruptive posture. They had fair warning from his confrontational behavior last month at the Group of 7 summit meeting in Canada, where he called the host, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, aVery dishonest and weaka in a Twitter post.Nevertheless, they emphasized that in general Mr. Trump was conciliatory in private sessions, though he was clearly upset by Thursday headlines indicating that he was happy with the NATO discussion on spending. To express his displeasure, he came late to the scheduled meetings and insisted on the emergency session on spending.Mr. Trump wanted to underline that he was not at all happy with the level of burden-sharing despite having agreed to the communiquA(c), and he urged countries lagging behind to move more quickly, according to a senior official who attended the special session. Alliance members have pledged to raise military spending to 2 percent of G.D.P. by 2024.The discussion was a healthy one, the official said. It created more urgency and it also allowed the summit meeting to end with an agreed message on improving spending, far better than an outcome where Mr. Trump was vocally unhappy and the others were perceived not to care, he added.Indeed, Mr. Trump came away mollified, broadcasting his own sense of triumph, though he had said the day before that member nations had to reach the 2 percent goal immediately, and that the target should rise to 4 percent.aIn the end I think the meeting was less divisive than feared,a said Alexander Vershbow, a former NATO deputy secretary general. aI think itas the reality show that the president loves. There wasnat enough drama, so Trump has a tantrum, knocks over the table, and allies are used as props in his reality show.aThat being said, he added, aNATO goes on.aThe substance of the meeting, he and others said, is in the communiquA(c). That document, a product of nearly a year of work, commits the alliance to a stronger deterrent against Russia, more efforts on cybersecurity, a strengthening of the allianceas southern strategy and a new training program for Iraq, Tunisia and Libya. It also called for nations to devote at least 20 percent of their growing military budgets to equipment and modernization.The United States pays 22 percent of NATOas budget, which covers things like offices, salaries and some equipment used in joint operations. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, of the $603 billion that the United States spends on the military each year, about $31 billion goes to Europe.In the end, some analysts criticized Mr. Trump for fabricating a ruckus that, however much it might serve his political ends, was harmful to the alliance.aNATO always had a good story to tell at this summit, with the communiquA(c) reflecting a robust and resilient alliance that is making real progress on a range of challenges,a said Amanda Sloat, a former State Department official now at the Brookings Institution. aTrumpas belligerent tweets and taunts unfortunately overshadowed what should have been a straightforward message of success.aThe drama in Brussels on Thursday was all about Mr. Trumpas desire to make noise for his political base, Ms. Sloat said. aSome say there was some victory for Trump, that he achieved what he wanted, but itas not true,a she said. aThere is no utility in creating all this noise, itas incredibly divisive.aIt is good to push for more defense spending, but allies are not like business partners, she said. aYou canat lambaste Germany one day and then ask them for something else the next,a she said. aActions and rhetoric have consequences. Blowing up summits and projecting disunity doesnat help credibility.aThen Mr. Trump moved on to Britain.Steven Erlanger and Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Brussels, and Katie Rogers from London.

The meeting produced an unusual joint declaration.CreditPool photo by Ng Han Guan BySteven Erlanger and Jane Perlez July 18, 2018 BRUSSELS -- From trade to regulation to security, America's traditional allies are accelerating their efforts to buttress a global system that President Trump has seemed prepared to tear down. After months of stunned indecision, they have undertaken a flurry of efforts intended to preserve the rules-based order the United States created after World War II and championed ever since. The most obvious example came on Monday, the same day a stunned world watched Mr. Trump praise President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a competitor after having dismissed Europe as an economic \"foe.\" A few thousand miles away, in Beijing, the leaders of the European Union and China held a long-scheduled meeting of their own. In the past, expectations for such meetings were low, given the conflicts on trade and human rights between the Europeans and the Chinese. But while those differences remain, this summit meeting produced an unusual joint declaration and a common commitment to keep the global system strong. The next day, the Europeans traveled to Japan and signed the biggest free-trade agreement in history, just the sort of deal the Trump administration has criticized. And on Wednesday, Europe's top regulator announced a $5.1 billion fine against Google, another strong indication that Brussels is not just fighting to maintain the rules-based trading order, but is also positioning itself as the watchdog of that system. After months of denial, anger, bargaining and depression, Europe and other parts of the world have accepted that Mr. Trump and his mission of disruption are not going away. Both France and Germany have started study groups on how to deal with the United States under Mr. Trump and how to find areas of leverage, especially on trade. The European Union is preparing whopping tariffs to counter Mr. Trump if he imposes \"national security\" tariffs on cars, a big issue for Germany. The European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, goes to Washington on July 25 to discuss the budding trade war. \"The one thing you could say in Trump's favor is, he's brought the world together on trade,\" said Jeffrey Wilson, the head of research at the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia. \"It's Trump versus the world,\" he said. \"Rather than all the other countries getting into trade disputes with each other, what's happening is there is a surprising amount of cooperation and comity.\" There are caveats, of course. The United States remains the world's leading economic and military power, and the Europeans in particular hope that Mr. Trump's successor will eventually return to embrace the global system. Europe still harbors considerable ambivalence about getting too close to China, which talks more about open trade than it actually practices. ImageThe Aomi International Container Terminal in Tokyo. Japan and the European Union signed the biggest free trade agreement in history on Tuesday.CreditKimimasa Mayama/EPA, via Shutterstock And the Europeans are unwilling to single out the United States as a villain -- in large part because they agree with Mr. Trump's complaints about China's predatory behavior and would rather join with Washington to alter Beijing's practices. But that route seems closed by Mr. Trump's unilateral trade warfare. So for now, the Europeans and others are making contingency plans. More than that, the language of pushback against Washington is strong and striking. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told the Europeans that both sides should \"join hands to defend multilateralism and a rules-based free-trade system,\" echoing comments he made at Davos in January 2017, before Mr. Trump started imposing tariffs. The European Council president, Donald Tusk, said that \"it is the common duty of Europe and China, but also America and Russia, not to destroy this order but to improve it.\" That duty is not simply to shun trade wars, he said, \"but to bravely and responsibly reform the rules-based international order.\" Mr. Tusk added: \"There is still time to prevent conflict and chaos.\" But the absence of American participation has for now set off a scramble for alternative partners. The European Union-Japan trade agreement, for instance, was accelerated last year when Mr. Trump abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal President Barack Obama and the Japanese intended as a bulwark against China. The European Union and China are not natural allies on trade. The Europeans, unlike the Trump administration, continue to push China on human rights violations. And in the past two years, in the face of Chinese investment, the Europeans have become much more critical of China's industrial espionage, its cavalier attitude toward intellectual property and its ambitions to overtake the West in advanced technologies. China has used special summit meetings with European Union members and aspirants, especially those in Central Europe and the Balkans, to push strategic infrastructure investments -- creating obligations and debt that could undermine the bloc's unity. European businesses have also grown disenchanted with the difficulties of operating in China, particularly rules about data retention and the presence of Communist Party units in workplaces. Still, both the European Union and China have benefited from the rules-based order Mr. Trump has challenged. So, oddly, he has given them reason to bridge their differences. China, in particular, is looking to Europe to help shore up the World Trade Organization so it can fend off a serious trade war with the United States. Mr. Trump's threats on Chinese exports have alarmed Beijing, said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. Beijing is making every effort to avoid publicly escalating its trade dispute with America, the council has said, but it is also rediscovering the merits of greater engagement with Europe. Chinese authorities, in particular, have sought to demonstrate to Europe that economic reforms are coming. Simon Fraser, a former top British diplomat now with the management consultancy Flint Global, said that European trade officials remained frustrated with China. Image President Trump at the NATO summit meeting in Brussels last week. Mr. Trump has called the Europeans an economic \"foe.\" CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times \"Trump has a point on China trade, and we want to work with the U.S. on this in the W.T.O., but we can't because Trump is slapping tariffs on us,\" he said. \"Europe is being pushed into a trade war no one wants, and again Trump has a good idea, but is going about it the wrong way.\" That was why this European Union-China summit was so important, after two years of meetings when the two sides could not even agree on a symbolic joint communique, said Theresa Fallon, director of the Center for Russia Europe Asia Studies, a research institution in Brussels. With China muting some of the demands of previous summit meetings -- primarily that Europe grant it \"market economy\" status -- the Europeans found more agreement with Beijing than in the past, while carefully keeping a distance. \"The European Union and China found some common ground at their summit, but even with Trump in the White House, the Europeans are mindful of the alliance with the United States of more than 50 years,\" said Jorg Wuttke, the former head of the European Chamber of Commerce in China. \"Common ground was found without changing sides.\" The communique mentioned the need for Chinese transparency and open markets, and the Europeans acknowledged the value of China's global infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative, without exactly endorsing it. The statement listed numerous infrastructure projects on which the two sides could cooperate. That was a considerable concession, Ms. Fallon said, given that 27 European Union ambassadors (all except Hungary's) signed a letter in April refusing to support Belt and Road because of its lack of transparency, lack of environmental protection and failure to provide a level playing field. The Europeans and Chinese also agreed to work on a bilateral investment treaty, another European concession. It was a dramatic change from the summit meeting of a year ago, noted Mr. Leonard. \"Last year was particularly grotesque,\" he said. \"Xi Jinping told Davos he was a champion of multilateralism and then refused to sign a joint statement with the European Union unless it granted China market economy status. But now that China finds itself under pressure, it is keen to have a common statement.\" China is taking steps to show it is more open to foreign investment, including approving a $10 billion petrochemicals project by Germany's BASF that does not require the joint venture structure typical of foreign investment. Ms. Fallon called it a favorable deal \"symbolic of the importance to China of Germany,\" about which Mr. Trump seems to have a special animus. However unlikely China and the European Union are to form a common front against Washington, both sides showed a willingness to compromise on the communique at a time Mr. Trump has waged his attacks. That is also true of the Japan-European Union trade deal, which cuts customs duties on European wine and cheese in exchange for gradually lowered tariffs on Japanese cars. For Japan, the deal represented a clear hedge against Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on Japanese cars, but it also gave Europe the kind of access to Japanese agricultural markets that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have granted to the United States if it had joined. For the European Union, a positive summit with China and a clear statement about cooperation to reform the W.T.O. and against unilateralism \"is clearly pointed at the United States,\" Ms. Fallon said. \"The Europeans want to show that we have other options -- and the trade deal with Japan is another display that we have other options.\" Steven Erlanger reported from Brussels, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.

Mehr als zwei Drittel sehen in dem US-Prasidenten eine Gefahr fur die Welt. Das belegt die Studie \"Die Angste der Deutschen\", die die R+V Versicherung jedes Jahr herausgibt. Einen Terroranschlag dagegen befurchten deutlich weniger Menschen. US-Prasident Donald Trump auf dem Nato-Gipfel in Brussel Bildrechte: dpa Mehr als zwei Drittel der Deutschen sehen in US-Prasident Donald Trump eine Bedrohung. Das geht aus der Langzeitstudie \"Die Angste der Deutschen 2018\" hervor, die die R+V Versicherung am Mittwoch vorgestellt hat. Demnach erwarten 69 Prozent der Befragten durch Trumps Politik eine \"gefahrlichere Welt\". Angst vor Fluchtlingen Nur wenig geringer ist die Angst der Deutschen in Bezug auf Fluchtlinge. Der Studie zufolge denken 63 Prozent der Bevolkerung, dass es zu Spannungen zwischen Deutschen und hier lebenden Auslandern kommt. Gleich gross ist die Sorge, dass Behorden und Menschen mit dem Zuzug von Fluchtlingen uberfordert sind. Vertrauen in Politik schwindet Die Uberforderung von Behorden und Politiker bereitet im Vergleich zum Vorjahr deutlich mehr Deutschen Angst. Sechs Prozentpunkte waren der hochste Zuwachs in der diesjahrigen R+V-Befragung. Die Frage nach der Trump-Politik wurde in diesem Jahr zum ersten Mal gestellt, weshalb es keine Vergleichswerte gibt. Deutlich weniger Angst vor Terror Deutlich weniger Angst haben die Deutschen vor einem moglichen Terroranschlag. Ihr Anteil an der Gesamtbevolkerung liegt der Studie zufolge bei 59 Prozent und damit zwolf Prozentpunkte unter dem Vorjahreswert, als der Terror noch die grosste Angst der Deutschen darstellte. Neuer Abschnitt Die Angste der Deutschen 2018 Die Angste der Deutschen 2018 mehr Zur Studie: In einer reprasentativen Stichprobe wurden zwischen dem 8. Juni und dem 18. Juli etwas mehr als 2.300 Personen im Alter ab 14 Jahren personlich befragt. Die Studie wird seit 1992 jahrlich von der R+V Versicherung durchgefuhrt. Fehler gefunden?

Bildrechte: dpa Brussel Trump gibt Nato-Bekenntnis ab Hauptinhalt Die Nato-Partner wollen nach den Worten von US-Prasident Trump ihre Verteidigungsausgaben erhohen. Konkrete Zahlen nannte er nicht. Aber er sicherte zu, weiter zu dem Bundnis zu stehen. Bundeskanzlerin Merkel hielt sich unterdessen bedeckt. Sie habe deutlich gemacht, dass Deutschland bereits der zweitgrosste Truppensteller in der Nato sei. US-Prasident Trump: Nato ist jetzt starker als vor zwei Tagen. Bildrechte: dpa US-Prasident Donald Trump hat zugesichert, dass sein Land weiter zur Nato steht. Nach einer Sondersitzung der Nato-Partner in Brussel sagte Trump, er glaube an das Bundnis. Trump zufolge haben mehrere Bundnispartner angekundigt, ihre Verteidigungshaushalte zu erhohen. Das sei ein enormer Fortschritt. Die USA seien bislang nicht fair behandelt worden. Jetzt werde man aber fair behandelt. Trump zufolge herrschte bei der Krisensitzung ein \"grossartiger kollegialer Geist\". Die Allianz sei jetzt viel starker als vor zwei Tagen. Der US-Prasident bekraftigte zugleich, wenn das Ziel bei den Verteidigungsausgaben von zwei Prozent der Wirtschaftsleistung erreicht sei, musse man sich hohere Ziele setzen. Vier Prozent sei die richtige Ziffer. Was genau bei der Krisensitzung besprochen wurde, ist nicht bekannt. Medienberichten zufolge wurde das Sondertreffen einberufen, weil Trump mit einem Alleingang der USA in Verteidigungsfragen gedroht hatte. Dazu ausserte sich Trump nicht. Merkel: Sind zweitgrosster Truppensteller Auch Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel hielt sich auf Nachfrage bedeckt. Sie erklarte, alle Bundnispartner hatten sich zur Nato bekannt. Alle hatten die deutliche Bereitschaft gezeigt, angesichts veranderter Sicherheitslagen ihren Beitrag zu leisten.Merkel sprach von sehr ernsten Diskussionen und einem sehr intensiven Gipfel. Mit Blick auf die Trump-Kritik an den deutschen Verteidigungsausgaben betonte die Kanzlerin, Deutschland musse sich zwar immer wieder fragen, was man gegebenenfalls noch mehr tun konne. Sie habe aber auch deutlich gemacht, dass Deutschland bereits der zweitgrosste Truppensteller in der Nato und seit Jahren in Afghanistan engagiert sei. Streit um Zwei-Prozent-Ziel Trump verlangt von Deutschland und den anderen Bundnispartnern, die Militarausgaben sofort auf die im Bundnis angestrebten zwei Prozent der Wirtschaftsleistung zu erhohen. Die Nato hatte 2014 vereinbart, die Verteidigungsausgaben binnen eines Jahrzehnts \"Richtung zwei Prozent\" zu erhohen. Deutschland kommt bisher nur auf 1,24 Prozent. Merkel hatte im Juni zugesichert, dass sie bis 2024 1,5 Prozent anstrebt. Nach jungsten Prognosen der Nato werden 2018 neben den USA nur Griechenland, Grossbritannien, Polen, Rumanien sowie Litauen, Lettland und Estland das Zwei-Prozent-Ziel erreichen. Fehler gefunden?

Juli 2018, 20:38 Uhr Die Kommentierungsdauer ist abgelaufen. Der Beitrag kann deshalb nicht mehr kommentiert werden. 11 Kommentare 13.07.2018 11:46 Frank 11 ,,Diejenigen, die entscheiden, sind nicht gewahlt, und diejenigen, die gewahlt werden, haben nichts zu entscheiden\", das sagte der damalige bayerische MP Seehofer in einem wohl lichten Moment [Quelle: ARD ,,Pelzig unterhalt sich\" 20.5.2010]. Wie Recht er doch hatte. Weder Trump, noch Merkel oder Stoltenberg entscheiden noch irgend etwas, sondern Interessengruppierungen, deren Vertreter man in der Offentlichkeit nicht bzw. kaum zu sehen bekommt. Diese Vorgaben, so wie sie jetzt gefordert und umgesetzt werden sollen, kommen zu einem grossen Teil aus der Rustungsindustrie. Milliarden Gewinne mit dem Leid, der Flucht und dem Tod von Millionen Menschen winken. Das einzige was wirklich zahlt ist Gewinnmaximierung um jeden Preis und als schone Fassade dient ihnen eine Scheindemokratie und das Feindbild Russland. 13.07.2018 10:00 Werner 10 @07:39 Frank 9: Eine bekannte weibliche Person ist kurz vor der Irak-Intervention, damals noch als Oppositionsfuhrerin, in die USA geflogen, und hat \"hier, wir machen mit\" signalisiert. Der damalige BK Schroder hatte diese (direkte) Beteiligung abgelehnt. Was der \"Dank\" war, mochte ich nicht spekulieren. Aber die Politik der weiblichen Person zum Thema Krieg in Nah-Ost, und daraus logisch folgenden Fluchtlinge, ist seit 2003 ausserordentlich kontinuierlich. Sie zieht sich \"wie ein Faden\" bis heute. Sowas wie \"der Stabilitats-Anker\" bei solcher vorausschauender Politik. Im Gegensatz zu einigen anderen 180-Grad-Wenden, und \"Mit-mir-wird-es-keine(*)-geben-Versprechen\". (*)Zutreffendes einsetzen - zuletzt war es die Maut, die es niemals nicht geben wird. 13.07.2018 07:39 Frank 9 Die Amerikaner bomben und die Deutschen zahlen. Das ist die verschrobene Logik des Imperiums. Der ehemalige deutsche Aussenminister Gabriel hatte es heute im SPON nicht deutlicher sagen konnen. Zitat: \"Wenn er (Trump) von uns Milliarden zuruckfordert fur die Militarausgaben der USA, dann mussen wir von ihm Milliarden zuruckfordern, die wir fur die Fluchtlinge ausgeben mussen, die gescheiterte US-Militarinterventionen zum Beispiel im Irak produziert haben\" und weiter \"Er gibt dem nordkoreanischen Diktator eine Bestandsgarantie und will gleichzeitig in Deutschland einen Regimewechsel. Das konnen wir uns schwer bieten lassen\"[ Quelle: SPON 13.7.18]. Die Wertegemeinschaft will ihre sogenannten Werte verteidigen und unterstutzt gleichzeitig einen der grossten Diktatoren unserer Zeit. Und nochmal Gabriel: \"Wir durfen uns keine Illusionen mehr machen. Donald Trump kennt nur Starke. Dann mussen wir ihm zeigen, dass wir stark sind.\" Abzug aller amerikanischer Atomwaffen aus D fordern, jetzt ! 13.07.2018 07:05 Wehrmeister 8 Trump hatte gestern in einem Interview erneut scharfe Kritik an der aus seiner Sicht zu grosszugigen Migrationspolitik in Europa geubt. Die Zuwanderung sei \"eine Schande\", sagte er. \"Ich denke, dass sie das Gefuge Europas verandert hat, und wenn man nicht sehr schnell handelt, wird es nie wieder sein, was es war, und ich meine das nicht positiv.\" Er fugte hinzu: \"Millionen uber Millionen Menschen zu erlauben, nach Europa zu kommen, ist sehr, sehr traurig.\" Aus seiner Sicht wurden die Europaer damit \"ihre Kultur verlieren\".Sehr prazise und vor allem sehr richtig. Der Mann wird mir immer sympathischer. 13.07.2018 00:01 part 7 Eigentlich geht es nur um die Welt- Handelshoheit uber die Dollar- Wahrung bei all den Kriegsbemuhungen der USA, die gern ihre Vasallen bemuhen, obwohl diese bereits andere wirtschaftliche Interessen vertreten. Alle Lander, die diesem Bemuhen im Weg stehen und sich nicht freiwillig einem Wirtschaftsdiktat beugen, drohen alsbald Sanktionen oder Bedrohungen. Die Nato hat als miltarischer Bundnispakt ausgedient, denn heute wird Krieg durch die US- dominierte Finanzwirtschaft betrieben, der sich kaum ein Land entziehen kann. Oder einfacher gesagt mit der Notenpresse wird eine gigantische Militaradministration am Laufen gehalten, furdie die Volker dieser Welt noch bezahlen sollen. 12.07.2018 22:20 Ludwig 6 Eine kleine Erganzung hatte ich, nur der Vollstandigkeit halber, fur den letzten Absatz des Artikels:Auch die Turkei ist NATO-Partner und wird das 2%-Ziel erreichen. In 2018 werden es konkret 2,2% sein, namlich 9,6 Milliarden Euro. Lasst sich ubrigens leicht recherchieren. 12.07.2018 18:05 pkeszler 5 Trump wechselt seine Meinung uber Deutschland schneller, wie andere ihre Hemden. Fur mich ist Trump und Co. gar keine Diskussion wurdig. Er soll sich in die USA einmischen und uns in Europa machen lassen, was wir wollen. 12.07.2018 17:26 Werner 4 @14:55 Michael Moller 1: \"die 2% finde ich nicht richtig solange es noch Kinder ,Rentner und Arbeitnehmer in der Armutsfalle sitzen keinen Cent mehr fur Rustung.\"Erstens spielen die 2% bei den Gesamtausgaben kaum eine Rolle, und zweitens wurden sie garantiert nicht fur die Genannten eingesetzt, selbst wenn das Geld vorhanden ware. Auch nur unter Druck und mit Widerwillen, bei Bildung, Infrastruktur, Digitalisierung... Polizei, Gerichte. Mit Brief und Siegel. Hab mir gerade das Original der PK von Trump auf Youtube angeschaut. Der Feindsender hat es eingestellt. Bestimmt wieder, um die Bevolkerung zu Verunsichern, und die, die man als Populisten bezeichnet, gegen die vorausschauende und burgernahe Politik aufzuhetzen. Aber eigentlich werden es seit 2015 immer mehr Feindsender um uns rundrum. Selbst ehemalige Brudervolker im Osten bis Suden zanken mit uns. Uberall. An was das liegt - keine Ahnung. 12.07.2018 17:06 Fragender Rentner 3 Wenn er an die Nato glauben sollte, dann bricht bestimmt bald der Weltuntergang an. 12.07.2018 16:15 colditzer 2 @Michael MollerSie haben tausendprozentig Recht.Trump erpresst alle.Und irgendwann werden alle kuschen und sich erpressen lassen.Das wird in den Medien nur anders bezeichnet.Die BW ist eine Parlamentsarmee und letztendlich entscheidet das Parlament ob der Bundeswehretat je 2 Prozent betragen wird.Ansonsten ist es schon erstaunlich, das gerade die Lander , wo fur die Menschen das wenigste Geld vorhanden ist, bzw. kurz vor dem Bankrott standen, 2 Prozent ausgeben.Griechanland und Rumanien.Und vor welchem Land furchtet sich Griechenland, vor der Turkei.Einem NATO-Land.So ist die Welt.

Even as he declared that the American commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance \"remains very strong\" ahead of his summit meeting next week with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, he continued to assail close partners and further strain diplomatic relations. In the closing hours of the two-day gathering in Brussels with leaders of the other NATO nations, he forced a last minute emergency meeting to address his grievances over spending. Then he called a news conference to claim credit for having pressured NATO members to boost their defense budgets \"like they never have before.\" That claim was quickly dismissed by the leaders of both Italy and France, who disputed that they had made any new pledges for boosting spending, adding to the sense of disarray. Through it all, possible threats from Russia -- and NATO's plans to keep it in check -- hung over the summit meeting, as fears in Europe have risen over Mr. Putin's increasing assertiveness. On Thursday, Mr. Trump dismissed concerns that his relationship with Russia was too cozy, or that his hardball tactics at NATO had played into the hands of Mr. Putin, whom he is to meet in Helsinki, Finland, next week. But after 48 hours of overt conflict with allies -- and the second international summit in two months where he has sparred openly with European leaders -- he said he looked forward to a positive encounter with the Russian president. \"I hope that we're going to be able to get along with Russia; I think that we probably will be able to,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We go into that meeting not looking for so much.\" The White House hastily called the news conference amid reports that Mr. Trump had unleashed a tirade at a closed-door morning meeting against member countries he complained were still not spending enough on their militaries. Mr. Trump used the news conference to hail himself, again, as a \"stable genius,\" saying he deserved \"total credit\" for pushing the allies to increase their military spending by more than previously agreed to. According to a person briefed on the meeting, Mr. Trump told other NATO leaders that if their countries did not meet the 2 percent standard by January, the United States \"would go it alone,\" a comment that some interpreted as a threat to withdraw from the alliance. (Other news reports quoted diplomats who said the president used slightly different wording -- saying that he would \"do my own thing,\" -- but he was not specific about what he meant in either case.) The contentious session prompted NATO leaders to convene a closed-door emergency session to discuss burden sharing within the alliance, and Mr. Trump emerged at the news conference to declare himself the victor. Mr. Trump sidestepped questions about whether he had threatened to abruptly leave the alliance, and said, \"I think I probably can, but that's unnecessary,\" because, he said, member countries \"have stepped up today like they've never stepped up before.\" \"The United States was not being treated fairly, but now we are,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I believe in NATO. I think NATO's a very important -- probably the greatest ever done.\" But Mr. Trump then quickly turned to asserting that the United States shouldered \"probably 90 percent of the cost of NATO.\" American contributions actually represent about 67 percent of all military expenditures by alliance members. The United States pays 22 percent of NATO's budget, which covers things like offices, salaries and some equipment used in joint operations. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, of the $603 billion that the United States spends on the military each year, about $31 billion goes to Europe. NATO members have pledged to devote at least 2 percent of gross domestic product to military spending by 2024. But Mr. Trump, after berating alliance countries for failing to meet a target that is six years away, then abruptly said Wednesday that they must do so immediately, and the figure should in fact be 4 percent. As Mr. Trump boarded Air Force One and flew to London for the next leg of his European trip, he left allies struggling to explain what had transpired. President Emmanuel Macron of France said that the meetings were \"active and demanding,\" but he rejected Mr. Trump's assertion that the NATO member countries had agreed to anything that was not already in place. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy sounded a similar theme. \"A communique was issued yesterday,\" Mr. Macron said. \"This communique is clear. It reaffirms the 2 percent by 2024 commitments. That's all.\" Mr. Conte said, \"Italy inherited spending commitments to NATO, commitments that we did not change, so no increase in spending.\" Mr. Macron added that the meeting ended with a stronger alliance because of Mr. Trump's reaffirmation of his commitment to it. Asked whether Mr. Trump had threatened to leave NATO, Mr. Macron said, \"Generally, I do not comment on what goes on behind the scenes, but at no moment did President Trump -- neither bilaterally nor multilaterally -- say that he was intending to leave NATO.\" Mr. Trump himself said, \"It all came together at the end, and yes, it was a little tough for a little while.\" He added, \"But ultimately, you can ask anybody at that meeting, they're really liking what happened over the last two days.\" Buoyed by what he considered to be his achievements at NATO, Mr. Trump also previewed his plans for his meeting with Mr. Putin. He said he would discuss the extension of one nuclear arms control treaty and violations of another, and might broach the topic of possibly stopping military exercises in the Baltics, a goal of Mr. Putin's. He evaded a question about whether he would recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Instead, he blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the annexation, saying, \"President Obama allowed that to happen. That was on his watch, not on my watch.\" Mr. Trump said that, after a weekend in Scotland at Turnberry -- a golf course and Trump business that he plugged in the news conference as \"magical\" -- he would go \"to a pretty hot spot\" to meet with Mr. Putin. Asked to characterize his relationship with the Russian president, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Putin as a \"competitor,\" not an enemy, adversary or friend, and tried to wave off expectations that the \"loose meeting\" with the Russian president would result in a substantive policy outcome. \"It could lead to something very productive,\" Mr. Trump said, \"and maybe it's not.\" When asked if Mr. Putin presented a security threat, Mr. Trump offered a grudging compliment: \"Hey, I don't want him to be. And that's, I guess, why we have NATO.\" Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Brussels, Aurelien Breeden from Paris, and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.

Should Americans Care? By Steven Erlanger Sept. 22, 2018 BRUSSELS -- President Trump seems determined to upend 70 years of established American foreign policy, especially toward Europe, which he regards as less ally than competitor. The Trump turnabout has set off a fervent search on both sides of the Atlantic for answers to hard questions about the global role of the United States, and what a frazzled Europe can and should do for itself, given a less reliable American partner. The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, speaking before a conference of all Germany's ambassadors last month, argued for a stronger European foreign and defense policy in the face of a suddenly uncertain future. \"The rules-based international order\" is eroding in a world where \"nothing can be taken for granted any more in foreign policy,\" he said. As a measure of just how cross-fertilized the thinking has become, Mr. Maas, a Socialist, cited the conservative American thinker Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution and his forthcoming book, \"The Jungle Grows Back: America and Our Imperiled World.\" His is one of several new books to take on the issues. In Mr. Kagan's view, the United States' retreat as the enforcer of the order it created after World War II is returning the world to its natural state -- a dark jungle of competing interests, clashing nationalism, tribalism and self-interest. \"The liberal world order established by the United States a little over seven decades ago is collapsing,\" Mr. Kagan writes, a function of American exhaustion with global burdens that began before Mr. Trump was elected and was one of the reasons for his victory. But as a tired America pulls back from tending what Mr. Kagan calls \"the garden\" of the liberal order -- an exceptional 70 years of relative peace and free trade, \"a historical anomaly\" made possible by U.S. leadership -- the dangers are considerable, especially for Europe, he argues. Already strained by populism and identity politics, Europe is in danger of returning to the strife that produced totalitarianism in the 1930s, he warns. \"The crucial issue is not the Middle East or even Russia, and it may not even be China,\" Mr. Kagan said. \"The big game is what it's been for over a century. If we lose Europe, if we send Europe back to its normal condition, it's over.\" But his prescription -- that the United States suck it up and understand that it must remain the indispensable guarantor -- is hardly universally shared at a moment when many appear sympathetic to Mr. Trump's complaint that America's allies do not do enough for collective defense. Julianne Smith, a former adviser to Vice President Biden and now a visiting fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin, recently traveled the United States talking about foreign policy. \"If in Washington the bipartisan view is do more, outside people ask if we've been too ambitious,\" she said. \"We're in a situation where the public doesn't see the evidence to support Kagan's arguments,\" she said. \"Congress is not there, the media is not there, the public is not there, and business is there only sometimes.\" Stephen M. Walt of Harvard University argues in his own forthcoming book, \"The Hell of Good Intentions: America's Foreign Policy Elite and the Decline of U.S. Primacy,\" that the United States should do less in the world, and a lot more selectively. Part of the \"realist\" school, Mr. Walt says that since the end of the Cold War, the United States has engaged in a series of expensive, largely unnecessary and ultimately failed efforts to remake nations in its own unusual image. The metaphor of a garden \"implies our role is benign and benevolent, when actually we've been blowing up a lot of stuff,\" he said. \"If we go running around the world on idealistic crusades, and some go badly, as they will, then public support for an activist foreign policy will decline.\" Tomas Valasek, who runs Carnegie Europe, a research institution, considers that view too pessimistic. \"I agree that it's not inevitable that the U.S. will always play the same role, but I disagree that mayhem necessarily follows,\" he said. \"The U.S. has changed Europe's security culture,\" making Europeans more conscious of the need to defend themselves. \"It's not the 1930s,\" Mr. Valasek said. \"There are ugly forces at work in Europe but not of the same kind, and I don't share Kagan's assumption that European elites will fail to respond.\" \"We must make clear to the American people that it's in their enlightened self-interest to stay engaged, and that others are stepping up, paying and doing their share,\" he added. The shift in American attitudes \"toward a post-imperial role\" began before Mr. Trump, with the failure of the Iraq war, noted Nathalie Tocci, director of Italy's Institute of International Affairs and an adviser to E.U. foreign-policy chief Federica Mogherini. But for her, \"the silver lining in Europe is that even the current dodgy leaders realize we're all very small.\" \"There is a growing realization that a stronger Europe and European Union are a necessity, whatever the faults,\" she said. Daniel W. Drezner, who teaches international politics at Tufts University's Fletcher School, argues that \"Americans are sick of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,\" but that both Mr. Kagan and Mr. Walt are wrong about American public opinion. \"Ask them about trade, immigration and alliances, and it turns out that Trump has made liberal internationalism great again,\" he said, with Americans favoring international trade and alliances with European and Asian democracies. Indeed, surveys show that American attitudes on trade and mutual alliances are the most positive in 40 years, said Ivo H. Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. \"Americans are not sick of foreign engagement but of stupid, endless foreign wars,\" he said. Mr. Daalder and James M. Lindsay also have a forthcoming book, \"The Empty Throne: America's Abdication of Global Leadership,\" describing the impact of what they consider the greatest shift in American foreign policy since the retreat from Europe after World War I. Like Mr. Kagan, they see dire consequences. But they also argue that even if Mr. Trump won't tend the liberal world order, America's nine most democratic allies can do more to preserve it -- in both global trade and security. Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Daalder call for a \"G-9\" of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Canada and the European Union to act more boldly in their own interest, as they are already doing on trade. Mr. Kagan wants to influence those choices. Despite mistakes in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, retreat in the name of \"reality\" is naive and ahistoric, he argues. \"After decades of living within the protective bubble of the liberal world order, we have forgotten what the world 'as it is' looks like,\" he said. \"To believe that the quarter-century after the Cold War has been a disaster is to forget what disaster means in world affairs.\" A ProposLa World Policy Conference Fondation WPC WPC TV Une initiative de l'Ifri Thierry de Montbrial Archives Contact (c) World Policy Conference 2018 | Tous droits reserves.

According to the Somali government, the warships will also be used to combat foreign ships disposing wastes onto the Somalia's waters. Somalia's ambassador to the European Union Dr. Ali Saed Faqi who visited Atlantic Marine Offshore company (AMOC) the manufacturing center for warships to oversee the process, said that establishing warships for the Somalia government will play a very important role in the protection the country's territorial waters. \"Getting these warships will help Somalia protect its sovereignty as well its territorial water. It will also protect any threat to Somalia from the sea that includes illegal fishing, illegal importation of firearms and pirates among others,\" said Faqi. Somalia has suffered from illegal unregulated fishing owing to inability to man its waters. A report last year by the US based campaign group Secure Fisheries warned of resurgence of piracy due to foreign illegal fishing. Foreign industrial fishing boats have resulted in \"depleted stocks, a loss of income for Somalis, and violence against local fishers\" the report read, adding \"it also has threatened to ignite local support for a return of piracy.\" Foreign boats are hauling in three times more than Somali fishermen -- an estimated 132,000 metric tonnes of fish each year compared to Somalia's catch of 40,000 metric tons, according to the report, based on multiple interviews and satellite evidence. According to Somali National News Agency, Atlantic Marine are expected to manufacture 6 warships in phase one of the agreement and others expected to follow suit after the first dispatch.

Even as he declared that the American commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance \"remains very strong\" ahead of his summit meeting next week with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, he continued to assail close partners and further strain diplomatic relations. In the closing hours of the two-day gathering in Brussels with leaders of the other NATO nations, he forced a last minute emergency meeting to address his grievances over spending. Then he called a news conference to claim credit for having pressured NATO members to boost their defense budgets \"like they never have before.\" That claim was quickly dismissed by the leaders of both Italy and France, who disputed that they had made any new pledges for boosting spending, adding to the sense of disarray. Through it all, possible threats from Russia -- and NATO's plans to keep it in check -- hung over the summit meeting, as fears in Europe have risen over Mr. Putin's increasing assertiveness. On Thursday, Mr. Trump dismissed concerns that his relationship with Russia was too cozy, or that his hardball tactics at NATO had played into the hands of Mr. Putin, whom he is to meet in Helsinki, Finland, next week. But after 48 hours of overt conflict with allies -- and the second international summit in two months where he has sparred openly with European leaders -- he said he looked forward to a positive encounter with the Russian president. \"I hope that we're going to be able to get along with Russia; I think that we probably will be able to,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We go into that meeting not looking for so much.\" The White House hastily called the news conference amid reports that Mr. Trump had unleashed a tirade at a closed-door morning meeting against member countries he complained were still not spending enough on their militaries. Mr. Trump used the news conference to hail himself, again, as a \"stable genius,\" saying he deserved \"total credit\" for pushing the allies to increase their military spending by more than previously agreed to. According to a person briefed on the meeting, Mr. Trump told other NATO leaders that if their countries did not meet the 2 percent standard by January, the United States \"would go it alone,\" a comment that some interpreted as a threat to withdraw from the alliance. (Other news reports quoted diplomats who said the president used slightly different wording -- saying that he would \"do my own thing,\" -- but he was not specific about what he meant in either case.) The contentious session prompted NATO leaders to convene a closed-door emergency session to discuss burden sharing within the alliance, and Mr. Trump emerged at the news conference to declare himself the victor. Mr. Trump sidestepped questions about whether he had threatened to abruptly leave the alliance, and said, \"I think I probably can, but that's unnecessary,\" because, he said, member countries \"have stepped up today like they've never stepped up before.\" \"The United States was not being treated fairly, but now we are,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I believe in NATO. I think NATO's a very important -- probably the greatest ever done.\" But Mr. Trump then quickly turned to asserting that the United States shouldered \"probably 90 percent of the cost of NATO.\" American contributions actually represent about 67 percent of all military expenditures by alliance members. The United States pays 22 percent of NATO's budget, which covers things like offices, salaries and some equipment used in joint operations. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, of the $603 billion that the United States spends on the military each year, about $31 billion goes to Europe. NATO members have pledged to devote at least 2 percent of gross domestic product to military spending by 2024. But Mr. Trump, after berating alliance countries for failing to meet a target that is six years away, then abruptly said Wednesday that they must do so immediately, and the figure should in fact be 4 percent. As Mr. Trump boarded Air Force One and flew to London for the next leg of his European trip, he left allies struggling to explain what had transpired. President Emmanuel Macron of France said that the meetings were \"active and demanding,\" but he rejected Mr. Trump's assertion that the NATO member countries had agreed to anything that was not already in place. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy sounded a similar theme. \"A communique was issued yesterday,\" Mr. Macron said. \"This communique is clear. It reaffirms the 2 percent by 2024 commitments. That's all.\" Mr. Conte said, \"Italy inherited spending commitments to NATO, commitments that we did not change, so no increase in spending.\" Mr. Macron added that the meeting ended with a stronger alliance because of Mr. Trump's reaffirmation of his commitment to it. Asked whether Mr. Trump had threatened to leave NATO, Mr. Macron said, \"Generally, I do not comment on what goes on behind the scenes, but at no moment did President Trump -- neither bilaterally nor multilaterally -- say that he was intending to leave NATO.\" Mr. Trump himself said, \"It all came together at the end, and yes, it was a little tough for a little while.\" He added, \"But ultimately, you can ask anybody at that meeting, they're really liking what happened over the last two days.\" Buoyed by what he considered to be his achievements at NATO, Mr. Trump also previewed his plans for his meeting with Mr. Putin. He said he would discuss the extension of one nuclear arms control treaty and violations of another, and might broach the topic of possibly stopping military exercises in the Baltics, a goal of Mr. Putin's. He evaded a question about whether he would recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Instead, he blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the annexation, saying, \"President Obama allowed that to happen. That was on his watch, not on my watch.\" Mr. Trump said that, after a weekend in Scotland at Turnberry -- a golf course and Trump business that he plugged in the news conference as \"magical\" -- he would go \"to a pretty hot spot\" to meet with Mr. Putin. Asked to characterize his relationship with the Russian president, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Putin as a \"competitor,\" not an enemy, adversary or friend, and tried to wave off expectations that the \"loose meeting\" with the Russian president would result in a substantive policy outcome. \"It could lead to something very productive,\" Mr. Trump said, \"and maybe it's not.\" When asked if Mr. Putin presented a security threat, Mr. Trump offered a grudging compliment: \"Hey, I don't want him to be. And that's, I guess, why we have NATO.\" Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Brussels, Aurelien Breeden from Paris, and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.

Putin of Russia.CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times ByJulie Hirschfeld Davis and Katie Rogers July 12, 2018 BRUSSELS -- President Trump reaffirmed support for NATO on Thursday, but only after stirring more discord with a vague threat that the United States could go its own way if the allies resisted his demands for additional military spending. Even as he declared that the American commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance \"remains very strong\" ahead of his summit meeting next week with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, he continued to assail close partners and further strain diplomatic relations. In the closing hours of the two-day gathering in Brussels with leaders of the other NATO nations, he forced a last minute emergency meeting to address his grievances over spending. Then he called a news conference to claim credit for having pressured NATO members to boost their defense budgets \"like they never have before.\" That claim was quickly dismissed by the leaders of both Italy and France, who disputed that they had made any new pledges for boosting spending, adding to the sense of disarray. Through it all, possible threats from Russia -- and NATO's plans to keep it in check -- hung over the summit meeting, as fears in Europe have risen over Mr. Putin's increasing assertiveness. On Thursday, Mr. Trump dismissed concerns that his relationship with Russia was too cozy, or that his hardball tactics at NATO had played into the hands of Mr. Putin, whom he is to meet in Helsinki, Finland, next week. But after 48 hours of overt conflict with allies -- and the second international summit in two months where he has sparred openly with European leaders -- he said he looked forward to a positive encounter with the Russian president. \"I hope that we're going to be able to get along with Russia; I think that we probably will be able to,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We go into that meeting not looking for so much.\" . The White House hastily called the news conference amid reports that Mr. Trump had unleashed a tirade at a closed-door morning meeting against member countries he complained were still not spending enough on their militaries. Mr. Trump used the news conference to hail himself, again, as a \"stable genius,\" saying he deserved \"total credit\" for pushing the allies to increase their military spending by more than previously agreed to. According to a person briefed on the meeting, Mr. Trump told other NATO leaders that if their countries did not meet the 2 percent standard by January, the United States \"would go it alone,\" a comment that some interpreted as a threat to withdraw from the alliance. (Other news reports quoted diplomats who said the president used slightly different wording -- saying that he would \"do my own thing,\" -- but he was not specific about what he meant in either case.) The contentious session prompted NATO leaders to convene a closed-door emergency session to discuss burden sharing within the alliance, and Mr. Trump emerged at the news conference to declare himself the victor. Mr. Trump sidestepped questions about whether he had threatened to abruptly leave the alliance, and said, \"I think I probably can, but that's unnecessary,\" because, he said, member countries \"have stepped up today like they've never stepped up before.\" \"The United States was not being treated fairly, but now we are,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I believe in NATO. I think NATO's a very important -- probably the greatest ever done.\" But Mr. Trump then quickly turned to asserting that the United States shouldered \"probably 90 percent of the cost of NATO.\" American contributions actually represent about 67 percent of all military expenditures by alliance members. The United States pays 22 percent of NATO's budget, which covers things like offices, salaries and some equipment used in joint operations. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, of the $603 billion that the United States spends on the military each year, about $31 billion goes to Europe. NATO members have pledged to devote at least 2 percent of gross domestic product to military spending by 2024. But Mr. Trump, after berating alliance countries for failing to meet a target that is six years away, then abruptly said Wednesday that they must do so immediately, and the figure should in fact be 4 percent. As Mr. Trump boarded Air Force One and flew to London for the next leg of his European trip, he left allies struggling to explain what had transpired. President Emmanuel Macron of France said that the meetings were \"active and demanding,\" but he rejected Mr. Trump's assertion that the NATO member countries had agreed to anything that was not already in place. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy sounded a similar theme. \"A communique was issued yesterday,\" Mr. Macron said. \"This communique is clear. It reaffirms the 2 percent by 2024 commitments. That's all.\" Mr. Conte said, \"Italy inherited spending commitments to NATO, commitments that we did not change, so no increase in spending.\" Mr. Macron added that the meeting ended with a stronger alliance because of Mr. Trump's reaffirmation of his commitment to it. Asked whether Mr. Trump had threatened to leave NATO, Mr. Macron said, \"Generally, I do not comment on what goes on behind the scenes, but at no moment did President Trump -- neither bilaterally nor multilaterally -- say that he was intending to leave NATO.\" Mr. Trump himself said, \"It all came together at the end, and yes, it was a little tough for a little while.\" He added, \"But ultimately, you can ask anybody at that meeting, they're really liking what happened over the last two days.\" Buoyed by what he considered to be his achievements at NATO, Mr. Trump also previewed his plans for his meeting with Mr. Putin. He said he would discuss the extension of one nuclear arms control treaty and violations of another, and might broach the topic of possibly stopping military exercises in the Baltics, a goal of Mr. Putin's. He evaded a question about whether he would recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Instead, he blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the annexation, saying, \"President Obama allowed that to happen. That was on his watch, not on my watch.\" Mr. Trump said that, after a weekend in Scotland at Turnberry -- a golf course and Trump business that he plugged in the news conference as \"magical\" -- he would go \"to a pretty hot spot\" to meet with Mr. Putin. Asked to characterize his relationship with the Russian president, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Putin as a \"competitor,\" not an enemy, adversary or friend, and tried to wave off expectations that the \"loose meeting\" with the Russian president would result in a substantive policy outcome. \"It could lead to something very productive,\" Mr. Trump said, \"and maybe it's not.\" When asked if Mr. Putin presented a security threat, Mr. Trump offered a grudging compliment: \"Hey, I don't want him to be. And that's, I guess, why we have NATO.\" Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Brussels, Aurelien Breeden from Paris, and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.

But Mr. Trump's insistence that other nations owe money erroneously indicates how the alliance works, and the figures he cites are misleading. ( Our reporters made the president's statements about the financial relationship between the United States and other NATO countries ) NATO has a budget to cover the shared costs and some equipment used in joint operations, and all 29 member countries contribute to it. None of the allies failed to contribute. Mr. Trump's protest is that while NATO member countries have agreed to spend at least 2% of their gross domestic assets on military spending, most do not. But no one has violated this agreement, because the figure of 2% is a goal to be achieved by 2024. Continue reading the main story According to NATO, all members have significantly increased military spending since 2014, and eight are expected to reach the goal this year . On Monday Trump tweeted that the United States accounted for 90% of the military spending of NATO countries, but the alliance states that the real figure is about 67%. And most of US military spending is not tied to NATO. Even so, the organization says on its website, \"There is an excess of alliance overall in the United States for providing essential capabilities, including, for example regarding intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, air-to-air refueling, ballistic missile defense, and airborne electronic warfare. \" - Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Steven Erlanger An area without Twitter? Trump finds a way If Mr. Trump was in a pungent mood as he entered the NATO meeting, his distrusting helpers and allies found a source of comfort: no Twitter. Mobile phones are banned from the room where the 29 leaders are picked up and NATO confuses signals in the building to prevent eavesdropping and hacking. So people did not expect Mr. Trump to have access to his favorite vehicle for at least a few hours. Somehow, the president found a way to tweet. As the opening meeting began in a secret Wednesday session Mr. Trump sent messages about the trade war he had escalated by levying customs duties for $ 200 billion of Chinese assets. He said he acted on behalf of American agriculture. I'm in Brussels, but I always think about our farmers. Soy beans have fallen by 50% since 2012 to my election. Farmers have been hurting for 15 years. The trade barriers and tariffs of other countries have destroyed their activities. I will open ... - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 11 July 2018 He continued on Twitter that he would open things \"better than ever, but he can not go too fast.\" I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers and I will win! \"[19659018] It was not clear whether Mr. Trump had violated the non-telephone rule of the NATO meeting, or if the tweet had been sent by a helper outside the room. But one thing was certain: there is no preservation of @realdonaldtrump from his followers. - Julie Hirschfeld Davis Continue reading the main story A show of solidarity with Ukraine NATO leaders will meet with their Ukrainian counterparts on Thursday to show solidarity in Kiev, after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, and in front of the continuous military support from Moscow to the rebels in eastern Ukraine. The meeting is a clear call from the West of the principle that one nation should not violate the territorial integrity of another. Talks on the settlement of the dispute in Ukraine are basically stalled. NATO leaders will meet with Georgia's leaders on Thursday, in a similar show supporting Tbilisi against Russia, which has occupied parts of the country since 2008. [19659024] Ukraine and Georgia will be invited to discuss their progress in security and defense reviews and their cooperation with NATO, but the long-delayed plans to have them join the alliance will remain suspended. - Steven Erlanger After NATO: Queen Elizabeth and Theresa May Continue reading the main story Source link Share Facebook Twitter Google + LinkedIn Pinterest Related Articles Czechs rally against PM Babis on Velvet Revolution anniversary Reality sets in for caravan migrants Argentine submarine: Government 'lacks means' to raise lost vessel Popular Posts Hearthstone: The Doomsday Project expansion brings back the mechs 1,795 City Council candidate accused of posting wife's topless pic after restraining order issued: report 1,319 Richard 'Old Man' Harrison of 'Pawn Stars' cuts son, Christopher, out of his will: report 942 Brazil's National Museum, 200 years old, goes up in flames 814 Powered by remonews.com | Designed by remonews - bhynh szy twsT ap tm (c) Copyright 2018, All Rights Reserved ", "keywords": ["twitter", "nato", "trump", "facebook", "google", "spending", "ukraine", "mr", "updates", "leaders"]}, {"url": null, "text": " November 17, 2018 Home Terms Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact US RSS Login Register Home World Africa Americas Asia Europe Middle East 8 U.N.

That was on his watch, not on my watch.\" Mr. Trump said that, after a weekend in Scotland at Turnberry -- a golf course and Trump business that he plugged in the news conference as \"magical\" -- he would go \"to a pretty hot spot\" to meet with Mr. Putin. Asked to characterize his relationship with the Russian president, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Putin as a \"competitor,\" not an enemy, adversary or friend, and tried to wave off expectations that the \"loose meeting\" with the Russian president would result in a substantive policy outcome. \"It could lead to something very productive,\" Mr. Trump said, \"and maybe it's not.\" When asked if Mr. Putin presented a security threat, Mr. Trump offered a grudging compliment: \"Hey, I don't want him to be. And that's, I guess, why we have NATO.\" Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Brussels, Aurelien Breeden from Paris, and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.

This created more urgency and also allowed the summit meeting to end with an agreed message on improving spending, far better than a result where Mr Trump was dissatisfied and that the others were perceived as not caring, he added. Mr Trump came back quieted, spreading his own feeling of triumph, although he said the day before that the member nations had to reach the target of 2% immediately, and that the target should reach 4%. I think the meeting was less divisive than dreaded, \"said Alexander Vershbow, a former NATO deputy general secretary.\" I think it's the reality show that the president likes. There was not enough drama, so Trump has a tantrum, hits over the table, and allies are used as props in his reality show. \" That being said, he added:\" NATO continues. \" According to him, the content of the meeting is contained in the communique.This document, the result of nearly a year of work, commits the alliance to a stronger deterrence against Russia, more than 39 efforts on cybersecurity, a strengthening of the Southern Alliance strategy and a new training program for Iraq, Tunisia and Libya.He also called on countries to devote at least 20% from their military budgets to equipment and modernization The United States is paying 22% of the NATO budget, including offices, salaries and some common equipment. International Institute for Strategic Studies, of the $ 603 billion that the United States spends each year on the military, about $ 31 billion is destined for Europe. Finally, some Analysts criticized Mr Trump for inventing a \"NATO has always had a good story to tell the communique reflects a strong and resilient alliance that is making real progress on a series of challenges. \"Said Amanda Sloat, a former state department official now at the Brookings Institution.\" Trump's tweets and warlike provocations have sadly eclipsed what should have been a mere message of success. \" Source link Share Facebook Twitter Google + LinkedIn Pinterest Related ArticlesJ Crew CEO leaves company as retailers struggle to cut salesNovember 17, 2018Forever Young: The Cygnus NG-10 Leaves Earth to the International Space StationNovember 17, 2018Maurice Hooker leaves the ground to stop Alex SaucedoNovember 17, 2018 Recent NewsVictoria's Secret Era is over?
