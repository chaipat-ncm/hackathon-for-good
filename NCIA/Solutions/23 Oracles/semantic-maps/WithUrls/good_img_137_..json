The president's decision can be framed first as a pragmatic and conservative hedge to a fragile and uncertain environment, reflecting ominous (and misplaced) lessons from the 2011 Iraq withdrawal. Second, and more broadly, the decision reflects an ongoing shift to a \"partnership\" approach of securing U.S. interests abroad with the help of foreign governments, which the president has pursued as a more sustainable model. But unless this decision is accompanied by other steps, it is illogical to believe that a few thousand more U.S. troops will significantly alter Afghanistan's chances of standing against the Taliban challenge. Until there is a viable political strategy for Afghanistan, any modicum of U.S. troops is, at best, playing not to lose. Doing better than that will require promoting three dimensions of political change in Afghanistan and between Kabul and Islamabad. Specifically, the White House needs to leverage its renewed engagement--the new troop commitment--by explicitly demanding that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his government emphasize unity and better governance and overcome petty squabbles of internal power sharing. At this stage, their very survival depends on it. In addition, the United States can use its new commitment to try, once again, to bring the Taliban to the table--not just by targeting militant leadership, but further by making the U.S. troop presence, and its targeting methodology, available for discussion within a political process. Finally, and just as important, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's upcoming visit to Washington gives the White House an opportunity to accomplish more effectively what it has struggled to do until now. The president should use Sharif's visit to force Pakistan to think twice about its assumption that the United States will eventually abandon Afghanistan, and to put real pressure on Pakistan to reduce their proxy support of the Taliban. The decision to keep troops beyond his time in office was the president's seventh, and potentially last, policy decision on Afghanistan. These perennial strategic \"review\" processes have typically been almost entirely about specific U.S. troop levels. The most significant of these seven reviews was the second, precipitated by the late 2009 leak of General Stanley McChrystal's stark \"assessment\" of the situation in Afghanistan as \"serious and deteriorating.\" That culminated in a \"surge\" of approximately 30,000 U.S. troops and a downgrading of the objective against the Taliban from \"defeat\" to \"degrade.\" The late-2009 review also stepped back from appearances of \"nation-building\" to emphasize instead a \"transition\" strategy of putting the Afghans in the lead, while retaining the original 2001 objective of seeking the \"defeat\" of al-Qaeda. Every review since 2009 has left those strategic objectives intact and instead tweaked troop level milestones, given that the military's 2010 projection of completing the transition process in 2014 increasingly appeared optimistic as each year passed. This most recent decision entailed the smallest troop adjustment to date, and yet this is a different kind of tweak. Whereas previous decisions adjusted the pace of withdrawing U.S. troops by the end of the president's second term, this recent decision shelves that fundamental aspiration. The president is no longer specifying a timeline for withdrawal. Rather, the latest decision redefines his new end-state: instead of 1,000 troops co-located with the Embassy in Kabul, there now will be 5,500 troops spread between Kabul and three outlying and enduring bases. Obama is thus handing his successor flexibility rather than closure. This is not merely political; it could also be leveraged toward a more effective strategy. This latest decision can be used to send a simultaneous message of U.S. endurance and commitment to Kabul, Islamabad and the Taliban. In terms of operational effect, it also enables the retention of two additional capabilities that would have been phased out next year: a modest counterterrorism platform and institutional advisors to mentor the Afghan security apparatus. In its simplest form, the shift provides enough troops to retain three outlying bases, which provide the next president counterterrorism platforms and some dividend on America's still-expensive strategic partnership with Afghanistan. Though 5,500 troops may be a 500 percent increase over the previous plan, it will not, of its own weight, change the trajectory of Afghanistan. Despite the unprecedented build up of Afghan police and army infrastructure, most reporting suggests that: 1) the security situation is sliding slowly in favor of the Taliban, 2) the Taliban is facing encroachment by Islamic State factions, and 3) the government's weak grip on Afghanistan is giving way to a gradual devolution toward warlordism. The U.S. counterterrorism capability of a few thousand troops staged at outlying bases may be adequate to address transnational threats to U.S. interests that might otherwise emerge from Afghanistan, but it can't be expected to make a strategic dent in the trajectory of the now intensifying conflict inside Afghanistan. As misplaced as comparisons are, Iraq and Afghanistan do share an important characteristic: Their conflicts are politically driven and can only be solved by political means. Hence, a ratcheting up of the political strategy is now critical. As misplaced as comparisons to Iraq are, the two countries do share an important common characteristic: Their conflicts are politically driven and can only be solved by political means. This is why the continuing focus on troop numbers--and reliance on the efficacy of U.S. military power--has disappointed. The military can only support, as a secondary and indirect effort, a strategy that places-- almost as a prerequisite--political will and governance infrastructure at its core. So the real potential in this shift is psychological--a signal to the region that neither the costs nor American fatigue with its presence are so great that the United States is prepared to wash its hands fully. In this light, it very much matters how Pakistan and the Taliban leadership respond to this decision. But what matters most is how the Afghan government, and particularly Ghani, proceeds from this point forward. On this front, Afghanistan is hardly an isolated case. Without a focus on the politics of the situation, U.S. training and equipping of foreign armies or militias is ineffective, as seen most dramatically in the failure of the Pentagon's program in Syria. Unfortunately, this political element is much harder to influence, particularly for a nation reluctant to get mired in \"nation-building.\" So it is that the United States has proceeded from one year to the next, from review to review, repeatedly considering rationale for extensions that the Afghanistan strategy needed a little more resourcing and a little more time, often with a half-promise that further extensions would not be required. Those who participated in back-to-back reviews, most notably the president, often probed this poor track record of strategic forecasting. Typically, the response was that conditions had changed and the strategy simply needed more time, not that the strategy wasn't working. Pakistan was always a known obstacle and risk to the Afghanistan strategy, but the real stumbling block has always been, as with elsewhere, that the political side of the strategy struggled to materialize. So the troops became a means to buy the necessary time and space for a political strategy to take hold. There is a fine line between a failing strategy and a strategy that simply needs more time. But at some point, and without a political strategy, it became clear that the United States was playing not to lose. One of the many lessons of these Afghanistan reviews is that it would be naive to expect 5,500 troops to salvage a sagging strategy. As the president said in announcing his decision, this reflects a shift away from costly, industrial-scale U.S. troop interventions toward a more \"sustainable\" approach based on partnerships. And yet recent U.S. experience has been that these partnerships offer little more than an operational platform if the partners' political will does not align with the military side of the partnership. And that means that aggressive implementation of a viable political strategy for Afghanistan remains the lynchpin. A second lesson is that the United States should not demand precision, and certainly not optimism, in assessing timelines or conditions. Foreign policy is an exercise in uncertainty, and a wise approach prepares for a range of potential futures, rather than faith in a single approach and a particular future. If nothing else, the U.S. experience in Afghanistan has exposed the historical debate over \"time-based\" vs. \"conditions-based\" strategies to be a false choice. Third, and relatedly, this decision to sustain troops is less about what the United States expects of its forces and more about its expectations in projecting against an uncertain future. Americans, and particularly America's military, are conditioned to play to win. Hedging against uncertainty, or playing not to lose, may feel un-American, but it has become the pragmatic alternative to the failed hubris of a world shaped by U.S. conditions, or its timelines. With more evolved strategies that bring political and governance factors more prominently into play, the United States might play to win once again.

deployments in Afghanistan at current levels, senior NATO officials said on Monday after the U.S. government decided to prolong its 14-year-old military presence there. NATO soldiers stand near a damaged NATO military vehicle at the site of a suicide car bomb blast in Kabul, Afghanistan, October 11, 2015. REUTERS/Omar Sobhani The Taliban's brief takeover of a provincial capital has raised concern about the strength of Afghan state forces and both the United States and its NATO allies now say events, rather than timetables, must dictate gradual troop reductions. Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's top commander in Europe, said he had assurances that NATO countries will continue alongside the nearly 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. While discussions of exact numbers are still continuing, the biggest national deployments are not in doubt, he said. \"Several of our largest contributors have already communicated with us that they will remain in their current posture,\" Breedlove told Reuters. He declined to give details. But a second senior NATO official said Germany, Turkey and Italy were willing to remain in Afghanistan at their current levels. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said last week that Italy is considering keeping its soldiers in Afghanistan for another year. The official said that \"our understanding is that is going to happen.\" Germany, as the top NATO-country contributor, has around 850 troops in Afghanistan, followed by Italy with 760 and about 500 for Turkey, according to the latest NATO data. \"We should make any changes on our troop structure based on conditions on the ground, not on schedules,\" Breedlove said. \"Other nations are already ringing in that they are committed.\" Unlike the United States, NATO has never set an end date to its \"Resolute Support\" training mission in Afghanistan, currently a 6,000-strong force that also includes troops from some 40 countries, including NATO members, the United States and their allies. A formal decision is expected to come at NATO's next meeting of its foreign ministers in Brussels in early December, a third official said. CAPABLE FORCES Although Afghan forces have recaptured the strategic northern city of Kunduz, its brief fall to the Taliban last month underscored concerns about the capabilities of Afghanistan's security forces. A U.S. military strike in Kunduz that hit an Afghan hospital run by Doctors Without Borders, or Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), also generated international outcry and underscored the perils of leaving a fragile country too quickly. U.S. President Barack Obama had aimed to withdraw all but a small U.S. force before leaving office, pinning his hopes on training and equipping local forces to contain Taliban militants fighting to return to power. But now he will slow plans to draw down U.S. troops from Afghanistan and instead keep the current force of 9,800 through most of 2016 before beginning to trim levels from 2017. Washington has spent around $65 billion on preparing the fledgling Afghan security forces of about 350,000 personnel. That is still far from complete, with Germany's Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen saying last week in Brussels that NATO needed to make sure the Afghans were capable of keeping their country stable. U.S. Defence Secretary Ash Carter is also preparing a U.S. funding request to sustain Afghan troops at their target peak levels of around 350,000 in 2017 \"and beyond\".

Rebecca Zimmerman President Obama recently revealed two changes to Afghanistan troop commitments. He also made another, vaguer commitment that has received far less attention. But it is this commitment -- to \"continue to support President Ashraf Ghani and the national unity government as they pursue critical reforms\" -- that will determine whether the U.S. troop commitment to Afghanistan has any value. Obama's intention to slow the withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2016 and to preserve a force of 5,500 in the country thereafter comes with no change of mission for America's military. Troops will continue to conduct two tasks: countering terrorist threats and advising Afghan security forces on development and operations. The truth, though, is that these two missions alone cannot save Afghanistan from an unfortunate future.... The remainder of this commentary is available on warontherocks.com.

Reuters: Omar Sobhani NATO agreed to its boldest steps yet to deter Russia from any attack in the Baltics or eastern Europe, setting out ways to rapidly deploy air, naval and ground forces without resorting to Cold War-era military bases. Key points:NATO measures show unity the West has not been able to muster against Russia, SyriaRussia denies it has acted aggressively1,000-troop presence could be backed by air, naval and special operations units of up to 40,000 In an effort to dissuade Moscow after its 2014 annexation of Crimea, NATO defence ministers will rely on a network of new alliance outposts, forces on rotation, warehoused equipment and regular war games, all backed by a rapid-reaction force.\"Russia is a threat,\" Lithuanian Defence Minister Juozas Olekas said at an alliance meeting in Brussels. \"It is Moscow's actions in Crimea, their support for separatists in Ukraine and their snap exercises that concern us.\"The measures, which British Defence Minister Michael Fallon said proved \"NATO means what it says\", showed a unity the West has not been able to muster against Russia in Syria, where the United States faces criticism for not stopping the Russian-backed assaults on rebel-held areas of Aleppo. We believe that especially when times are difficult, as they are now, it's even more important that we have political dialogue, channels open, between NATO and Russia. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he would meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at the Munich Security Conference later this week to stress the defensive nature of NATO's strategy for the Baltics and eastern Europe.\"We believe that especially when times are difficult, as they are now, it's even more important that we have political dialogue, channels open, between NATO and Russia,\" he said.Russia denies it has acted aggressively. Moscow blames the West for stirring anti-Russian feeling across the east, particularly in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, which it considers its historic sphere of influence.The crisis in Ukraine, where the West accuses Russia of fomenting a separatist rebellion, and the Western economic sanctions on Moscow have raised concerns about a new Cold War.Non-NATO member Georgia, which fought a five-day war with Russia in 2008 that left two of its regions occupied by Russian military, also warned NATO to be on alert. \"With the Kremlin, nothing can be excluded,\" Tinatin Khidasheli, Georgia's defence minister, said. \"They cannot show weakness.\"Poland's new conservative government has been the most vocal in calling for permanent NATO bases on its territory and while Warsaw has now agreed to the new lighter military presence, its Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz signalled that difficult talks over troop numbers lie ahead.Money and troops wanted Photo NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (C) addresses the defence ministers meeting. Reuters: Yves Herman Initial discussions suggest NATO could have a brigade of up to 1,000 troops in each of the six former communist countries, once under Moscow's domination, that the alliance is looking to reinforce: Lithuanian, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania. They will be backed by a rapid-reaction force that includes air, naval and special operations units of up to 40,000 personnel. Asked about whether a 1,000-troop presence was acceptable, Mr Macierewicz said: \"From our point of view it is clearly too little.\"US Defence Secretary Ash Carter said the plan aimed to move NATO to a \"full deterrence posture\" to thwart any aggression but cautioned: \"It's not going to look like it did back in Cold War days.\"In the past, the US stationed some 300,000 troops in Europe and NATO wants to avoid any such posture because of the costs and also so as not to further antagonise the Kremlin.Britain said it would contribute two warships to a NATO maritime groups this year, sending one frigate to the Baltic.Another difficult issue is the funding for the deterrent, which Mr Stoltenberg has said \"does not come for free\".The US is seeking a $3.4 billion budget for European reassurance initiatives in 2017, a four-fold increase in Washington's spending in the region to rotate more troops through the region and provide more tanks and other support.Mr Carter, speaking to reporters travelling with him to Brussels, said it was important for all NATO allies to increase military spending. \"I'll be looking for others in NATO to echo (us) in our investment,\" Mr Carter said.Mr Stoltenberg said he received new commitments from other NATO allies on Wednesday, but said it was too early to give details.

Raheel Sharif promised Afghan leaders that he would press Pakistan-based Taliban leaders to resume peace talks and take action against those who resort to terrorism and violence. Against the backdrop of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's friendly visit to Islamabad earlier this month, Sharif's announcement has raised hopes that the Afghan reconciliation process and related steps can help end the country's bloodshed. The Afghan government announced that in early January, Pakistani, Afghan, U.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Islamabad to decide on a road map for reconciliation and reduction in fighting and violence. This is a positive development. However, Pakistan's record on Afghanistan calls for caution and sustained pressure. Whether or not there is concrete progress by the start of the next fighting season in late March will be an indicator of Pakistani intentions. For the past several years, Pakistani officials have deflected American and Afghan requests to shut down the sanctuaries that the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network enjoy in their country and cut off support to the insurgency from Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence Agency by offering help in promoting peace talks. Pakistan's interest in a negotiated settlement to the Afghan war seems real enough, but the Pakistani military has never been willing to take the very steps most likely to advance the process, which are to close down Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network operations in Pakistan and imprison any of their leaders not actively negotiating peace with the government in Kabul. Why does the Pakistani military want to maintain cooperative relations with the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network? This policy likely stems from some combination of opportunism and fear. It sees the Taliban/Haqqani as surrogate forces that could protect and advance Pakistani interests in Afghanistan, while combating Indian influence. But Pakistani authorities also fear that if they put too much pressure on the Afghan Taliban, it might join forces with the Pakistani Taliban in the latter's effort to overthrow the Pakistani government and introduce a radical Islamist regime. Since 2010, the Obama government has pursued a negotiated settlement to the Afghan conflict and sought Pakistan's help in this regard. Ghani, since taking office in late 2014, has expended a good deal of his own political capital in relations with Pakistan, and paid a steep price as a result of the sparse return on investment. Ghani chose Islamabad as the first foreign capital to visit upon his election. Seeking to turn a new page in relations, he followed up with a number of unilateral steps to demonstrate his commitment to a new relationship. Notably, Afghan security forces arrested Pakistani Taliban leaders and turned them over to Islamabad. After years of flatly denying that it harbors insurgents, Pakistan admitted to maintaining contacts with the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network, and offered to act as a conduit between the Taliban and the United States and Afghanistan. Pakistan also convened one symbolic meeting between the Afghan government and the Taliban--which occurred in the presence of U.S. and Chinese observers--but failed to persuade the Taliban to reduce its military operation against coalition and Afghan forces. In fact, military pressure on the Afghan government and civilians escalated and no follow-on meetings have taken place since. The Taliban have advanced in the south, east and northern areas of Afghanistan. Afghan forces have fought bravely but appear overextended. ISIS and Al-Qaeda also have made their presence felt in the country. Ghani is now politically weakened at home because his gambit with Pakistan has not paid off. Once the death two years earlier of the Taliban's founding leader Mullah Omar was revealed, Pakistan engineered the accession of Mullah Akhtar Mansour to the leadership position. The head of the Haqqani network, a longstanding surrogate of Pakistan, emerged as Mansour's deputy. Division within the Taliban high command makes genuine peace negotiations difficult. This may have enhanced Pakistan's influence over the dominant faction of the Taliban, but also exacerbated fault lines within the extremist movement when a number of Taliban rejected Mansour's leadership. Pakistan may now be in a stronger position to influence Mansour's followers--the largest Taliban faction--but probably cannot deliver all of the Taliban to any peace process. Division within the Taliban high command makes genuine peace negotiations difficult, and the Taliban's recent advances on the battlefield probably diminish its interest in any real accommodation with the government in Kabul. This suggests that Washington and Kabul should focus less on fostering talks and more on persuading Pakistan to take action against those engaged in terrorism and violence. While opening peace talks could be a positive step, it will only yield fruit if Pakistani authorities also begin to close down Afghan Taliban military operations. Without Pakistani initiative, talks with the Taliban are unlikely to succeed. Perhaps with Pakistani consent and support the Taliban will continue to push their advantage on the ground. Alternatively, given ground realities, the Taliban might demand that the United States and Afghanistan cede provinces in the east and the south to them. Territorial demands in particular would prove unacceptable to Washington and Kabul, as they would create a new terrorist sanctuary and serve as a launching pad for insurgents to divide Afghanistan and seize Kabul. Continued U.S. pressure is needed to induce Pakistani cooperation in reducing the violence. Continued U.S. pressure is needed to induce Pakistani cooperation in reducing the violence. Congress withheld nearly a third of the military assistance allocated to Pakistan for 2015 due to Islamabad's failure to take meaningful action against the Haqqani network. An even larger proportion of the assistance should be conditioned in the coming year on Islamabad closing down the Haqqani network and Taliban military in the country. Another step that would steer Pakistan in a more cooperative direction is for the United States to move urgently in addressing the gaps in Afghan capabilities identified during the last fighting season in areas such as intelligence, logistics and air support. Washington should not rule out deploying some additional forces and easing rules of engagement for targeting the Taliban and ISIS targets. At this juncture, sustained and intensified pressure on Pakistan offers the only viable path to advancing the reconciliation process in a way that does not turn Afghanistan into a launching pad for terrorism and extremism.

(Reuters: Omar Sobhani) Related Story: Barack Obama to keep US troops in Afghanistan through 2016 Related Story: Afghan forces recapture Kunduz amid fierce clashes with Taliban Map: Afghanistan Germany, Turkey and Italy are set to keep their deployments in Afghanistan at current levels, senior NATO officials say, following the US government's decision to prolong its 14-year-old military presence there. Key pointsNATO set to keep ground forces in AfghanistanNumber of troops remains unspecifiedOfficial announcement due in December The Taliban's brief takeover of a provincial capital has raised concern about the strength of Afghan state forces and both the United States and its NATO allies now say events, rather than timetables, must dictate gradual troop reductions.General Philip Breedlove, NATO's top commander in Europe, said he had assurances that NATO countries would continue alongside the nearly 10,000 US troops in Afghanistan. We should make any changes on our troop structure based on conditions on the ground, not on schedules. NATO commander General Philip Breedlove While discussions of exact numbers are still continuing, the biggest national deployments are not in doubt, he said.\"Several of our largest contributors have already communicated with us that they will remain in their current posture,\" General Breedlove said.He declined to give details. But a second senior NATO official said Germany, Turkey and Italy were willing to remain in Afghanistan at their current levels.Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi said last week that Italy is considering keeping its soldiers in Afghanistan for another year.The NATO official said that \"our understanding is that is going to happen\".Germany, as the top NATO-country contributor, has around 850 troops in Afghanistan, followed by Italy with 760 and about 500 for Turkey, according to the latest NATO data.\"We should make any changes on our troop structure based on conditions on the ground, not on schedules,\" General Breedlove said.\"Other nations are already ringing in that they are committed.\"Unlike the United States, NATO has never set an end date to its \"Resolute Support\" training mission in Afghanistan, currently a 6,000-strong force that also includes troops from some 40 countries, including NATO members, the United States and their allies.A formal decision is expected to come at NATO's next meeting of its foreign ministers in Brussels in early December, a third official said.Capabilities of Afghan forces remain uncertainAlthough Afghan forces have recaptured the strategic northern city of Kunduz, its brief fall to the Taliban last month underscored concerns about the capabilities of Afghanistan's security forces.US president Barack Obama had aimed to withdraw all but a small US force before leaving office, pinning his hopes on training and equipping local forces to contain Taliban militants fighting to return to power.But now he will slow plans to draw down US troops from Afghanistan and instead keep the current force of 9,800 through most of 2016 before beginning to trim levels from 2017.Washington has spent around $US90 billion ($124 billion) on preparing the fledgling Afghan security forces of about 350,000 personnel.That is still far from complete, with Germany's defence minister Ursula von der Leyen saying last week in Brussels that NATO needed to make sure the Afghans were capable of keeping their country stable.US defence secretary Ash Carter is also preparing a US funding request to sustain Afghan troops at their target peak levels of around 350,000 in 2017 \"and beyond\".Reuters Topics: unrest-conflict-and-war, army, world-politics, afghanistan, united-states Top Stories Joint US-Australian naval base on Manus a 'significant pushback' against China The little girl Australia shunned -- remembering Eve van Grafhorst Grieving relatives angered as Argentina says it can't recover submarine Opinion: European countries have banned landfill.

Nato has not released the nationalities of the other victims or the five left injured.A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the crash was \"an accident and not the result of insurgent activity\".The families of the British victims have been informed, the MoD said.They have asked for a period of grace before their names are released.The accident comes after a convoy of UK military vehicles was attacked in Kabul, the Afghan capital, on Sunday morning. Seven people were injured and there were no UK casualties, the MoD said.Observation balloonThe two RAF personnel were from 230 and 33 squadrons, both of which are based at RAF Benson, Oxfordshire, the MoD spokesman said.He added: \"The helicopter crashed while landing at the headquarters of Resolute Support: the Nato train, advise and assist mission in Afghanistan. \"The incident is currently under investigation but we can confirm that it was an accident and not the result of insurgent activity.\"BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said: \"The BBC understands the RAF Puma that crashed in Kabul had been transferring Nato military personnel.\"Helicopter movements of military personnel are more frequent following attacks - such as the one that took place on a British military convoy earlier today.\"The cause of the crash is still being investigated but an observation balloon became untethered and landed in the Resolute Support base in Kabul.\"Image copyright AFP Image caption Nato troops examine a crater at the site of the bomb attack that targeted a UK convoy British combat troops pulled out of Afghanistan a year ago after a conflict that lasted 13 years and in which 454 UK troops lost their lives.Nato's Resolute Support mission, which was launched after its combat mission ended, consists of more than 13,000 troops from 42 countries, including nearly 500 UK troops.It focuses on training and supporting Afghan security forces and institutions after the International Security Assistance Force stood down last year.The coalition aircraft crashed with 10 people on board, Resolute Support said in a statement.\"The incident resulted in the death of five Resolute Support personnel and the injury of five others,\" it said.\"It is Resolute Support policy to defer casualty identification to the relevant national authority. The incident is currently under investigation.\"RayMabusPosts : 73553 2014-04-12 Re: Britanci dobili zeleno svijetlo za obaranje ruskih aviona by RayMabus on 10/12/2015, 08:40Taliban attack UK military convoy in Afghan capital Kabulhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34498998RayMabusPosts : 73553 2014-04-12 Re: Britanci dobili zeleno svijetlo za obaranje ruskih aviona by RayMabus on 10/12/2015, 08:45Ide to njima ...napad na konwoj , razwaljeno wozilo 7 ranjenih .....par sati kasnije helikopter srusen pet mrtwih ukljucujuci dva pilota RAFa.RayMabusPosts : 73553 2014-04-12 Re: Britanci dobili zeleno svijetlo za obaranje ruskih aviona by Guest on 10/12/2015, 08:47Dobro gnoje Briti...

Frank-Walter Steinmeier made the remarks in an interview with the German Bild am Sonntag newspaper, whose extracts were published on Saturday. \"What we shouldn't do now is inflame the situation further through saber-rattling and warmongering,\" Steinmeier said, adding, \"We are well-advised to not create pretexts to renew an old confrontation.\" NATO launched the Anakonda-16 maneuver on June 7, simulating a Russian attack on Poland. The two-week-long exercise involves some 31,000 troops, dozens of ships and fighter jets, along with 3,000 vehicles. \"Whoever believes that a symbolic tank parade on the alliance's eastern border will bring security, is mistaken,\" Steinmeier said. He further called for more dialogue and cooperation with Russia, warning that it would be \"fatal to now narrow the focus to the military.\" NATO is expected to send units to Romania as part of plans to expand its presence in Eastern Europe. It will also send four battalions in Poland as well as the Baltic states of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia, which are likely to number 2,500-3,000 troops combined with a small force designed to act as a tripwire. The deployment is slated to be formally authorized during a summit in the Polish capital city of Warsaw next month. In another development on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin once again criticized NATO's eastward expansion, warning that there would be consequences if the Western military alliance continued its one-sided policy against Moscow. He made the comments during a question and answer session at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum 2016. The Russian president also noted that his country does not want a new Cold War with the West, stressing that Moscow's policy is \"aimed at cooperation and search for compromise.\" NATO has stepped up its military build-up near Russia's borders since it suspended all ties with Moscow in April 2014 after the Black Sea Crimean Peninsula re-integrated into the Russian Federation following a referendum. Moscow has repeatedly repudiated NATO's expansion near its borders, saying such a move poses a threat to both regional and international peace. Last month, NATO formally invited Montenegro to become its 29th member, prompting the Kremlin to warn that the decision risked fueling geopolitical tensions across Europe.

Surgeons hope a donated organ from a recently deceased man will provide full function including urination, sensation and sex. The surgery requires joining nerves and blood vessels under a microscope. Doctors and advocates who work with wounded soldiers note that the loss of the penis is one of the most emotionally traumatic injuries because it affects a sense of identity and manhood, especially for men hoping to become fathers. \"When you meet these guys and you realise what they've given for the country, it makes a lot of sense,\" Dr. Richard Redett, a plastic surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital who will help perform the operation, told Reuters. The recipient, who was not identified, lost most of his penis and had substantial groin injuries in a bomb explosion while deployed overseas. Media reports have said he was wounded in Afghanistan. The surgery could occur in the coming weeks. Doctors are looking for a donor who is a good match in terms of age and skin color. The donor's family will need to give permission for the penis to be removed. There have been two penis transplants in the world. The first in China in 2006 was unsuccessful. The second in South Africa in 2014 was a success. Thor Wold, who served as a Marine medic in the Iraq war and now works as an advocate for veterans, said that after suffering genital injuries servicemen immediately wanted to know if they would still have sexual function. \"They would ask, 'Is everything OK down there, doc? My wife's at home and we're trying to have a baby when I get back,'\" Wold told Reuters. Redett said a veteran suffering from a blast injury could need to have not just his penis replaced but also the scrotum, part of the abdominal wall, groin tissue and part of the inner thigh. \"We've sorted out how to take that block of tissue from a donor and give it to a recipient,\" he said. The penis transplant does not involve the testes, where sperm are produced, so if a man with a transplanted penis does father a child, the baby would be his genetic offspring, not the donor's. While for now only wounded veterans are being considered for penis transplants, the surgery could eventually be performed on men with birth defects and transgender men and women.

How You Should Approach This Site. Resources - The House science committee is worse than the Benghazi committee - Vox How One Woman Changed The Way People Die In Mongolia : Goats and Soda : NPR - Military Phrases - Business Insider November 11, 2015 | Filed under: Military and tagged with: Language, Military Phrases, US military A full battle-rattle of military phraseology. Every region of the country has its own unique phrases, but they have nothing on the complex lexicon that people in the US military share. Members of the military serve together in close-knit groups that must fully trust each other. Potentially serving in dangerous areas, service members must be able to communicate as efficiently as possible while still being understood. This need for quick communication, coupled with the strict uniformity of the military, has produced an amazing range of slang terms and acronyms that only military members can understand -- \"I was on the FOB when the IDP hit, so I radioed the TOC\" doesn't mean much in the civilian world, after all. 1. \"15 minutes prior to 15 minutes prior\" Sgt. Brian Glass/US Army Military people are taught that they must show up to everything (especially an official formation) at least 15 minutes early. The 15 minutes to 15 minutes arises as the order filters down through the ranks. The captain wants everyone to meet at 0600, so the master sergeant wants folks to arrive at 0545 -- and when the order finally finally hits the corporal-level people are told to show up at midnight. 2. \"A good piece of gear\" (in reference to people) Flickr/US Army Only in the service is it OK to refer to one of your coworkers or (worse yet and most frequently) a person working for you in a section you manage as \"a good piece of gear.\" 3. \"Blue falcon\" via U.S. Marine Corps A Blue Falcon is someone who blatantly throws another Marine/soldier/sailor/airman under the bus. You don't want to be called a Blue Falcon. 4. \"Days and a wake-up\" U.S. Army / Sgt. Michael J. MacLeod A \"wake-up\" refers to the last day you will be some place (generally while deployed). So, if a service member is getting ready for bed on a Sunday, and flying out on a Friday, he'll say \"four days and a wake-up.\" 5. A \"drug deal\" via Reddit When personnel or material are obtained through unofficial channels. 6. \"Embrace the suck\" Pfc. Cameron Boyd/US Army Military service isn't all fun. In fact, it is mostly suck. For every five seconds of hanging out of a helicopter, there are countless eternities spent enduring safety briefs and doing mundane tasks (picking up cigarette butts, buffing floors, toilets, etc.). And then there is the unpleasantness of being pinned beneath an inescapable and ever-present rank structure. Troops are encouraged to embrace this sad reality. 7. \"Field strip\" Thomson Reuters Literally refers to taking apart weapons to the extent authorized for routine cleaning, lubrication, and minor repairs while in \"the field.\" Field stripping can also be used informally to describe taking apart anything. If a Humvee becomes stuck or broken outside of base, troops will field strip it of anything classified or of value before leaving it behind. If you park your car in a bad part of town, it may be on cinder blocks by the next morning, completely field stripped. 8. \"Full battle-rattle\" Cpl. Alfred Lopez/ US Marine Corps This phrase refers to all the gear servicemen and women are required to carry outside the wire. Generally: flak jacket with protective plates, Kevlar, 180 rounds of ammunition, water, rations, rifle. It's called \"battle rattle\" because -- unless we're talking about Navy SEALs -- walking with all this stuff usually makes noise. 9. \"Good initiative, bad judgment\" REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha When a problem needs to be solved but the selected means of solving the problem is itself more problematic. Generally, it shows \"good initiative\" because the problem might have been above the pay grade of person trying to solve it. 10. \"Grunt by association\" US Marine Corps Photo Often used as a compliment in the Marine Corps to describe someone who does not have the official qualification in an infantry field, but has worked on a daily basis with the infantry. It's usually used for artillerymen or drivers, people who are deployed for extended periods of time with the infantry. 11. \"Mandatory Fun\" or \"Mandofun\" US Army Office dinner parties or get togethers that are mandatory. Sometimes these are just understood as mandatory, other times the order is given expressly. 12. \"Birth-control glasses\" US Army photo Military-issued eyeglasses known for their lack of aesthetic appeal. 13. \"No impact, no idea\" Nick Irving/Reaper33 If a shooter on the range is so far off target that spotters don't see an impact. Used loosely to mean that the speaker doesn't understand an idea, or that someone is totally clueless. Similar to \"high and off to the right,\" which is the military equivalent of \"out of left field\" -- a personality type gone crazy, or an idea that no one saw coming. 14. \"Chair Force\" via U.S. Army An Air Force-specific term for personnel who never fly planes, but instead spend their time \"flying a desk.\" Those in the Chair Force do office work. \"Chair Force\" is also used as a pejorative against the Air Force by the other services. 15. \"PowerPoint ranger\" US Army photo Like a member of the Chair Force, a \"PowerPoint ranger\" is a service member tasked primarily with creating Power Points for briefings. PowerPoint rangers can be notorious for creating overly complicated briefs that feature too many animations or sound effects. 16. \"Civvies\" Flickr / Joseph Brent Clothes a member of the military wears off-duty, just like a normal civilian would wear on the street. 17. \"Police call\" HBO/Generation Kill A police call is when an entire unit lines up and walks across a certain area looking for trash. \"Policing,\" on the other hand, is when a unit internally checks the behavior of its members, or when people are ordered to take care of their own outward deficiencies (e.g., \"Police that mustache!\"). 18. \"S-- hot\" U.S. Marine Corps Facebook Page Something that is really awesome, hardcore, or tactically skilled. For example, you can be \"s-- hot\" at your job. An operation that was carried out well would also be \"s-- hot.\" 19. \"Sniper check\" AP/Bullit Marquez Giving a salute to an officer in the field. Salutes given to an officer are normally prohibited in the field since they would identify an officer to an enemy, making the officer the possible target of a sniper. 20. \"Standby to standby\" and \"hurry up and wait\" Sgt. Jennifer Pirante/US Marine Corps Believe it or not, the military is government, and government isn't always efficient. \"Standby\" is a \"preparatory command.\" Usually the order to standby alerts a unit that it will receive some kind of marching orders -- \"standby to launch.\" Unofficially, it's used to tell junior members to be ready and wait. Often, troops find themselves waiting for long periods of time because of logistics or command indecisiveness. Said sarcastically, \"standby to standby\" means that a unit is waiting to wait some more. \"Hurry up and wait,\" also said sarcastically, pokes fun at the military's propensity to perform tasks quickly, and then sit idly for long periods of time. 21. \"Voluntarily Told,\" \"Voluntold\" Sgt. Christopher Green/USMC Sgt. Maj. of the Marine Corps Micheal P. Barrett, left, speaks a man dressed as Santa Claus during the 55th Annual U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots Program in Washington, D.C., Dec. 3, 2012. There are two different kinds of voluntold: A. The gunny walks into the office and says, \"Man, wouldn't the floor look nice if somebody buffed it?\" Which means,\"Buff the floor.\" B. \"I need two volunteers to stand out in front of Best Buy this Saturday collecting Toys for Tots.\" \" ... \" \"Jones, Smith, you're collecting Toys for Tots this weekend.\" 22. \"Smoking and joking\" Michael Smith/Argunners Being unproductive, horsing around, or literally smoking and joking. 23. \"Secret squirrel\" US Marine Corps Photo Intelligence personnel, secret communications, classified ops, or someone with higher classification. 24. \"Make a hole\" DVIDS/Octavia Davis Drill instructor Sgt. Donald Miller corrects a recruit on March 25, 2014, on Parris Island, South Carolina. \"Make a hole\" is the preferred method to tell a group of people to get out of your way. 25. \"Check your six\" Flickr/US Air Force A U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor, 49th Fighter Wing, Holloman Air Force Base, N.M., flies over the Nevada Test and Training Range for a training mission. An Air Force term for \"watch out behind you\" based on looking for enemy aircraft or missiles to the rear at the 6 o'clock position. \"Check your six\" is also used in bars or other crowded areas to discretely tell a friend to check out someone behind them.

REUTERS/Omar SobhaniSoldiers near a damaged civilian vehicle following the Kabul blast It was a suicide bombing against a foreign forces convoy in a crowded part of the city and there are casualties\" Najib Danish, deputy spokesperson for the interior ministry The Talbian said the attack was in response to the US hospital bombing in Kunduz which left 22 people dead.A statement from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said: \"We can confirm that at approximately 9:10 this morning a convoy of UK military vehicles on a routine road move as part of the NATO Resolute Support Mission in Kabul was struck by an Improvised Explosive Device. There were no UK casualties.\"Najib Danish, deputy spokesperson for the interior ministry, added: \"It was a suicide bombing against a foreign forces convoy in a crowded part of the city and there are casualties.The US-led Resolute Support military coalition also confirmed that one of its convoys was struck by a bomb, although dismissed Taliban claims that a number of foreign troops had been killed in the attack. The terrorist organisation are renowned for inflating casualty figures for attacks on US of Afghan forces. REUTERS/Omar SobhaniAfghan security forces walk past a damaged NATO vehicleThe attack has come at a time of increasing tensions in northern Afghanistan. The Taliban stormed Kunduz earlier this month, holding it for three days before withdrawing - although pockets of insurgents have remained. REUTERS/Omar SobhaniAfghan security personnel keep watch at the bomb siteLast weekend in the same city, 22 people were killed when a hospital run by charity Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) was reportedly bombed by either US and Afghan forces. Twelve staff members and 10 patients were killed, with 33 others still missing. MSF claim that both sides in the conflict were aware of the hospital's location yet bombing continued for an hour despite desperate calls to military offices in Kabul and Washington. REUTERS/Omar SobhaniA bomb crater at the site of the explosionThe US has changed its account of how the attack came about, initially claiming that American forces had come under fire from within the hospital before claiming that air strikes were requested by Afghan forces. The Afghan military claim that \"armed terrorists\" had been using the hospital as a base, a claim totally rejected by MSF.

Obama had aimed to withdraw all but a small US-embassy based force at Kabul before leaving office in January 2017. Under the new plan, troops will be drawn down to 5,500 starting sometime in 2017 and based at four locations - Kabul, Bagram, Jalalabad and Kandahar. The decision comes after months of deliberations between Obama, Afghan leaders, Pentagon officials, commanders in the field and White House advisers about how best to continue to support Afghan forces, senior US administration officials said. \"Those have been broad discussions, deep discussions, ones that have included the president's personal engagement and a number of very detailed questions from the president about our posture,\" an official said. The US troops will continue to train and advise Afghan forces, and also will focus on ensuring that any remnants of al Qaeda are prevented from posing a threat to US security, the officials said. \"Our mission won't change,\" an official said. The US-led coalition in Afghanistan ended its combat mission after 13 years of war at the end of 2014, and Afghan troops have since been in charge of the nation's security, with help from US and NATO troops. But Afghan forces have struggled recently in assaults from Taliban militants, who briefly took over the northern city of Kunduz. \"Certainly we're watching and seeing how the Afghan security forces engage quite tenaciously in the fight in Kunduz,\" an official said. US military and administration officials have been discussing a slower timetable since the March visit to the White House of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, the officials said. \"The Afghan government is very comfortable with this commitment. They've been indicating a desire for this commitment for some time,\" an official said. Keeping 5,500 troops at four locations will cost about $14.6 billion per year, up from the estimated cost of $10 billion to keep a consolidated force at the Kabul embassy, the official said. NATO allies also have indicated some interest in sustaining their presence, the official said. There are more than 6,000 non-US forces in Afghanistan as part of the 'Resolute Support' mission.

State-run TV said in the report that three gunmen wearing white laboratory coats began spraying bullets after a suicide bomber on foot blew himself up at the backdoor entrance, sparking chaos inside the 400-bed facility. \"I saw one of the attackers, armed with an AK-47 and dressed as a doctor, shooting at patients and guards on the third floor,\" hospital nurse Abdul Qadeer was quoted as saying by the TV. \"They shot my friend but I managed to flee... I had to jump over the barbed wire to escape.\" The attackers were gunned down after special forces landed on the roof of the hospital in a military helicopter. \"More than 30 people were killed and around 50 wounded in today's attack,\" defence ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri said, adding that most of the victims are patients, doctors and nurses. Afghan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah condemned the attack saying this is a criminal act. Nothing can justify an attack on hospitals. \"We will never forgive these criminals. Unfortunately, this attack has resulted in some casualties,\" he added.

NBC reported this week that the White House was studying the legal ramifications of expelling the cleric, who lives in exile in Pennsylvania, as part of an effort to persuade Turkey to ease its pressure on Saudi Arabia over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. \"It's not under consideration,\" Trump told reporters shortly before departing on a daylong trip to California to meet with officials and victims, as well as firefighters battling the deadly wildfires there. \"We are doing very well with Turkey,\" Trump said. \"I get along very well with the president (Recep Tayyip Erdogan). He's a friend of mine. He's a strong man, a tough man and a smart man, so whatever we can do, we'll do... but at this point? No.\" US-Turkish relations have recently been strained, but they warmed up after Ankara's release in October of American pastor Andrew Brunson. The fate of Gulen, who has denied any involvement in the attempted coup in Turkey and whom Washington has repeatedly refused to extradite, remains a central point of tension between the countries. Gulen's teachings inspired the growth of a moderate, pro-Western Islamic movement that includes scores of schools, hospitals, and businesses worldwide. He left Turkey for the US in the 1990s after being accused of calling for the overthrow of the government. He has denied the charges and lives with supporters in a rural compound in northeastern Pennsylvania. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert had earlier rejected the NBC report that the White House was seeking a way to extradite Gulen, who reportedly has a US green card. She insisted that \"there is no relation\" between the extradition issue and Turkish pressure on Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi's murder at the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul. Trump has been restrained in his criticism of the Saudis, saying on Saturday that \"they give us a lot of jobs, economic development (and have been) a truly spectacular ally.\" P:23:48/L:0:57/R:0:59 Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Continue Reading Health Alcohol deaths in U.S. soar Published 3 hours ago on November 18, 2018 By M M Alam NEW YORK: Alcohol is killing more adults in the United States than the opioid epidemic, according to a new study. From 2007 to 2017, the number of deaths attributable to alcohol increased 35 percent, the USA Today newspaper reported, citing the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle. Deaths among men rose 29 percent while rising 67 percent among women, the study found, an alarming statistic because females once drank far less than males. Deaths among people aged 45 to 64 rose by about 25 percent. \"The story is that no one has noticed this,\" Max Griswold, who helped develop the alcohol estimates for the institute, said. \"It hasn't really been researched before.\" Washington, DC, the capital of the United States, had the highest rate of death from alcohol in the country, according to the institute's analysis. The institute published a study in August that showed no amount of alcohol consumption is healthy and any slight health benefits of drinking alcohol are clearly offset by the risks. The US opioid crisis, which kills about 72,000 people a year, has turned away America's attention from the slower moving epidemic of alcohol, especially in Southern states and the nation's capital. \"It's an increase that has been obscured by the opioid epidemic. But alcohol kills more people each year than overdoses - through cancer, liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis and suicide, among other ways,aEUR USA Today said in its report. Well Being Trust, a health advocacy group, called the rising mortality rates from alcohol, drugs, and suicide \"despair deaths.\" Drinking can lead to cancers all along the digestive tract, from the mouth to the colon. About 15 percent of US breast cancer cases are considered to be caused by alcohol. The \"direct toxicity\" of alcohol damages the nervous system from the brain down to the spinal cord and to peripheral nerves, says Dr. Anthony Marchetti, an emergency room doctor at Upson Regional Medical Center in Thomaston, Georgia. Marchetti said long-term alcohol drinking can also lead to heart failure, infections due to immune suppression, a type of dementia from alcohol-induced brain damage, stomach ulcers and a much higher risk of cancer. Between 2008 and 2014, the rate of ER visits involving acute alcohol consumption rose nearly 40 percent, according to the study in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. Psychologists attribute growing alcoholism to the high level of workplace stress that began accelerating during the Great Recession, loneliness linked to social media and increasing pressures on working mo the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. The opioid epidemic kills an average of 72,000 people per year, while alcohol kills 88,000. In those 88,000 deaths are 2.5 million years of potential life lost, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The surge of alcohol-related deaths is new. In ten years, the number of deaths by alcohol have increased 35 percent according to the new report shared by USA Today on Friday. The statistics are based on findings from 2007 to 2017. Most affected by the rising alcohol epidemic are young women. Among women, deaths rose 67 percent, while for men, the percentage rose only 27 percent. Women are more susceptible to alcohol-related risks because they typically weigh less than men, and can feel the effects of alcohol faster, according to the National Institute on Alcohol and Abuse and Alcoholism. The complications that most affect women who drink excessively are Liver Damage, Heart Disease, Breast Cancer and complications with pregnancy. According to a survey by the Institute in 2015, 9.3 percent of women surveyed drank alcohol while pregnant in the month before taking the survey. 51.1 percent of women drank alcohol in general, 22 percent of them engaging in binge drinking in the month prior. 61.3 percent of men drank in the month prior to the survey, and 32.1 percent binge drank. 5.4 percent of the female drinkers received help for an alcohol disorder, while 7.4 percent of men did. Teen drinking deaths rates are down 16 percent while drinking deaths for those between the ages of 45 and 64 increased about 25 percent. The deaths associated with over-drinking are not necessarily instantaneous. Many of the causes lie in issues developed over time from excessive drinkings, like liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, cancer, and suicide. In terms of location, the District of Columbia tops the list for most alcohol deaths. ItaEUR(tm)s followed by Georgia and Alabama. States with lower alcohol control policies, like Nevada, Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota and Wyoming, have higher rates of binge drinking than those with stricter restrictions. app Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Continue Reading Politics Yemen at crucial moment: UN Published 3 hours ago on November 18, 2018 By Hissan Sheikh UNITED NATIONS: Delivering impassioned pleas on behalf of 14 million civilians teetering on the edge of famine in Yemen, senior United Nations and civil society leaders emphasized that a new 'window of hope' has now opened in that country's devastating and overlooked war. \"Never has so much international attention and energy been given to this crisis, and rightly so, Martin Griffiths, the Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Yemen, told the UN Security Council on Friday. Welcoming the light recently shed on the situation, he reminded 15-member Council that the situation nevertheless remains the world's largest humanitarian disaster with an ongoing fight against famine, civilians dying from preventable diseases and an economy on the verge of collapse. \"This is a crucial moment,\" he said, noting that he has spent the last two months seeking support from the warring parties for an updated version of a framework for negotiations. Outlining the contents of that newly-emerged framework -- including the establishment of principles and parameters for United Nations-led, inclusive Yemeni political negotiations, a set of interim security and political arrangements to end fighting, the return of Sana'a's friendly relations with neighbouring countries and a restoration of State institutions -- he said he plans to visit Yemen next week to draw attention to the continued need for a pause in fighting. Welcoming the recent announcement by Yemen President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi of plans to move swiftly towards a political solution, he urged Council members to seize the current momentum and pursue a comprehensive and inclusive settlement to the conflict. Mark Lowcock, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, recalled his October warning to the Council that a grave economic crisis and escalating conflict had pushed Yemen closer to famine than ever before. Shortly afterward, an alert was issued that the world's largest food security emergency faces catastrophic deterioration. In that regard, he reiterated the five priority requests he previously delivered to the Council, namely: A cessation of hostilities in and around infrastructure on which aid operations and commercial importers rely; the protection of food and essential goods; a larger and faster injection of foreign exchange into the economy; an increase in funding and support for the humanitarian operation; and the parties' full and open engagement with the Special Envoy. The World Food Programme's (WFP) Executive Director, David Beasley, emphasized that the words heartbreaking and tragic do not do the conflict in Yemen justice. Describing his recent trip to the country, he said soft words cannot properly illustrate what is happening to civilians there, the stuff of nightmares, horror, deprivation, and misery. Beasley said that he had witnessed a country on the brink of catastrophe: \"What I have seen in Yemen this week is the stuff of nightmares, of horror, of deprivation, of misery. And we - all of humanity -- have only ourselves to blame.\" Noting that the value of the Yemeni rial has dropped by 235 percent since January 2015, he said the price of basic food staples has doubled in the last eight months while household incomes are declining. Meanwhile, Yemen -- unlike other conflict-affected countries -- cannot grow its own food, and there are 3.6 million more hungry people in the country than three months ago. Rasha Jarhum, Founder and Director of the Peace Track Initiative Yemen, said children's cries in Yemen go unnoticed as the conflict parties continue to use weapons in populated areas. Underlining the severe impacts on Yemeni women and girls, she said rapes and child marriages are soaring. Women have been assaulted by Houthi gangs and have had family members abducted. Calling for an immediate ceasefire, she also called for a ban on the arms and mines flowing into Yemen as well as on the recruitment of child soldiers. Peacekeepers from totally neutral States should be deployed to Yemen and the results of the National Dialogue should guide a transition to peace, she said. As Council members took the floor, many underscored that while delegations are often divided on issues before them, today they stand largely united on the situation in Yemen. Speakers around the table agreed on the need for urgent political progress, while also voicing support for the Special Envoy's political plans and the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator's five priority requests. Some welcomed the initiative to relaunch political negotiations in Stockholm, Sweden, at the end of November, while others urged their fellow Council members to use their individual and collective leverage to bring the parties to the table. The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres plans to convene a high-level conference on Yemen with a focus on the 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan, in February. app Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Continue Reading Advertisement Facebook Latest Trending Videos Politics2 hours ago No plan to extradite Gulen to Turkey: Trump Crime3 hours ago Slain SamiulHaq's remains to be exhumed!

A man and his two sons were killed at their home in Ghani Khel, a district in the south of Nangarhar, on the border with Pakistan, said Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the provincial governor. \"After the bomb blast hit them, the American forces then started shooting and killed one man and two children nearby,\" he said. The U.S. military command in Kabul said a convoy of American and Afghan troops was struck by a roadside bomb and attacked by gunmen. \"The convoy returned fire in self-defence and there were no U.S. casualties,\" the command said in a statement. There had been no official report of civilian casualties filed, but the military was investigating the incident, the U.S. military said in a statement. \"We take civilian casualties very seriously and all allegations are thoroughly investigated,\" it said. Civilian casualties have run at near record highs as fighting spreads to more areas of Afghanistan, according to the United Nations. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani generally has been less vocal than his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, in publicly criticising the U.S. military when troops are involved in incidents where civilians are killed. On Saturday, three American soldiers were killed and one wounded when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them in Nangarhar, where elite U.S. troops have been helping Afghan forces battle Islamic State militants. Also over the weekend, an American air strike in southern Afghanistan killed at least three Afghan policemen and wounded several during a joint operation by Afghan and U.S. special forces. U.S. and Afghan troops have been battling militants in Nangarhar province for months. Islamic State, or Daesh as it is known in Afghanistan, has established a stronghold in the region, which borders Pakistan. U.S. military officials estimate there are about 600 to 800 Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan, mostly in Nangarhar, but also in the neighbouring province of Kunar. The increase in involvement by U.S troops and warplanes comes as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration weighs whether to deploy more troops in the war-torn country. Reuters reported in late April that the U.S. administration was carrying out a review of Afghanistan and there were conversations over whether to send between 3,000 and 5,000 U.S. and coalition troops to Afghanistan. Deliberations include giving more authority to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters. This could allow U.S. advisers to work with Afghan troops below the corps level, potentially putting them closer to fighting, a U.S. official said. -Reuters Related News:Russia may ease Ukraine's gas terms, but Kiev must settle its billsUS State Department watered down human trafficking reportPope of the people, and the politics, in historic US visitMaldives vice president arrested in probe of explosion targeting President Abdulla YameenRussia orders US to cut diplomatic staff, says to seize diplomatic propertyWar room 2.0?

He further added that the plans include a 1.7-billion-euro investment in satellite communications to better support troops and ships deployed across the alliance, as well as aiding the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones. It was not immediately clear if NATO allies would fund a new military communications satellite to be launched into space or if an increase in broadband capacity could be gained from existing U.S. and other allied satellites. \"The proposals, for which some funding must still be approved by NATO governments, also envisage spending about 800 million euros on the computer systems that help command air and missile defences,\" said the official, who declined to be named. The official maintained that NATO will present its needs in detail at a conference in Ottawa in April and then begin launching the bidding process. It is likely to attract major Western defence contracts including Airbus Group, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Corp,\" the official added.

Astronomers studied Barnard's Star, a red dwarf just six light years away - practically in our back garden, galactically speaking -- and noticed the presence of a \"frozen, dimly lit world\" at least 3.2 times heavier than Earth. The planet, known for now as Barnard's Star b, is the second nearest to Earth outside the solar system and orbits its host star once every 233 days. \"It's important because it's really our next door neighbor and we like to meet our neighbors in general,\" Ignasi Ribas, from the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia and Spain's Institute of Space Sciences, told AFP. Despite being relatively close to its parent star, the planet receives less than two percent of the energy Earth gets from the Sun, and the team estimates it has a surface temperature of -170 degrees Celsius (-274 Fahrenheit) - far too cold to support life as we know it. \"It's definitely not in the habitable zone, no liquid water. If it has any water or gas this is probably in solid form so that's why we call it frozen,\" said Ribas. In mankind's bid to map the planets in the night sky, most historical research has focused on brighter, newer stars, which produce more light and increase the chances of scientists noticing anything orbiting them. But since Barnard's Star is a red dwarf, a small and cooling star probably about twice as old as the Sun, it produces relatively little light making it hard to discern any bodies in its orbit. To find Barnard's Star b, Ribas and the team studied more than 20 years' worth of observations from seven separate instruments. They then used a phenomenon known as the Doppler effect to track the impact of its gravitational pull on its parent star. Astronomers can use this technique to measure a planet's velocity and, therefore, mass. \"We have all worked very hard on this breakthrough,\" said Guillem Anglada Escude, from London's Queen Mary University, who co-authored the study published in the journal Nature. The team worked with the European Southern Observatory using astronomical instruments so accurate they can detect changes in a star's velocity as small as 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles) per hour -- a gentle walking pace. It's thought that Barnard's Star is tearing through space at around 500,000 km/h, making it the fastest-moving known object in the universe. Ribas said that although stargazers could predict its size and orbit with relative accuracy using the Doppler effect, any attempt at this stage to find out what the new planet looked like would be \"guesswork\". \"It's sort of in a fuzzy area with respect to its properties. We've seen planets of this mass be rocky, meaning that it could look like Earth with a solid surface with potentially some atmosphere or some frozen layer on top,\" he said. \"Or it may be what we call a mini-Neptune, like a scaled-down version of the gas giants of our solar system.\" It might be cold, inhospitable and all but invisible but the new planet has one thing going for it: it's really close. The only known exoplanet closer to Earth was discovered in 2016 orbiting one of a cluster of stars in the Alpha Centauri system, just over four light-years away. \"There's not so many stars in our immediate neighborhood. The investment to find them is expensive,\" said Ribas. \"It's really near and therefore if you have the hope - like I do - of eventually seeing these planets to study them in detail we have to start with the immediate ones. It could lead potentially to other discoveries.\" Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Continue Reading Economy Rocket-maker ArianeGroup to cut 2,300 jobs Published 5 days ago on November 13, 2018 By News Desk PARIS: European aerospace and defense firm ArianeGroup is to cut 2,300 jobs by 2022 as orders tumble and development of a new rocket nears its end, management said Monday. The company said it faced tough competition from US space companies whose business is \"bolstered by a large volume of institutional orders\". ArianeGroup will make the cuts by not replacing staff who leave or retire. A joint venture by European aerospace company Airbus and the French group Safran, it currently employs 9,000 people in France and Germany. Constructor of the Ariane rockets, the European Space Agency workhorse, ArianeGroup also produces ballistic missiles. Ariane 5 rockets are soon to be replaced by the Ariane 6 which will be an estimated 40 percent cheaper to make, under pressure in particular from Elon Musk's SpaceX. But European buyers have so far ordered only three Ariane 6 rockets ahead of the first scheduled launch in 2020. Other nations such as India and the United States give priority to their own space companies and \"close their markets to foreign competition\", ArianeGroup complained. Arianespace, the company which launches the rockets, recently indicated it was facing \"unprecedented competition\", notably from SpaceX. The US firm now places in orbit more rockets that Arianespace, responsible for most European launches. \"The Americans -- let's not mince our words - have decided to kill off the Europeans,\" one ArianeGroup trade union recently said in an internal memo, charging that European space companies have only belatedly decided to back Ariane 6.

This plant, which will have a 40-megawatt capacity, is the result of a partnership agreement between the QEWC, the US company AES and Japan's Mitsui to develop an electricity generation plant, al-Muhannadi announced in an interview with Qatar News Agency (QNA) aired on Sunday. The stake of Nebras Power, an affiliate of Qatar Electricity and Water Company, is 24 percent. Al-Muhannadi noted Nebras Power has carried out a number of construction and acquisition projects for power plants in various countries such as Oman, Jordan, and Indonesia, which are operated by different types of fuels, including the solar energy. Nabras Power has acquired 24% of the IPP4 power plant in Jordan, which generates electricity using natural gas and liquid fuel with a capacity of 240 MW, he pointed out. Nebras Power, the regional and global leader in the development of power and desalination projects, has developed with its partners the largest solar power plant in Jordan, the Shams Ma'an Solar Power Plant, with a total capacity of 52.5 MW and is currently working with its project partners to develop a new solar power plant in the Kingdom with a capacity of 40 megawatts. app Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Continue Reading Advertisement Facebook Latest Trending Videos Politics2 hours ago No plan to extradite Gulen to Turkey: Trump Crime3 hours ago Slain SamiulHaq's remains to be exhumed!
