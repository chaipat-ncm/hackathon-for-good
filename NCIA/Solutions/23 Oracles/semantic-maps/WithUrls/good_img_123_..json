(AFP, file photo) Related Story: Afghan insurgents gaining control around former Australian base Map: Afghanistan The Afghan city where Australian forces were based for more than a decade is on the verge of again falling to the Taliban, after days of deadly strikes by insurgents. Dozens of Taliban fighters and several policeman are believed to have been killed during coordinated attacks on checkpoints near Tarin Kot, the capital of Afghanistan's Uruzgan province.\"[The militants] are in some areas as close as one kilometre and in some, five kilometres to the main city,\" Uruzgan security chief Abdul Qawi was quoted as saying by Afghan media.In an online post, the Taliban claimed to have overrun 15 Government outposts, including a \"strategic military base\" in Uruzgan.\"All the surrounding areas of the capital are under tight siege and attacks of mujahideen,\" the group said.Australia handed over control of the Tarin Kot military base to the Afghan Government in December 2013.Defence officials in Canberra are now closely monitoring developments in the Uruzgan capital.In February, Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said insurgents were getting the upper hand in many districts around the former Australian military base in Tarin Kot. \"Insurgents have increased their freedom of movement and generally contain ANDSF (Afghan National Defence and Security Forces) units to their bases and their checkpoints,\" he told a Senate Estimates hearing. Australian forces completed their withdrawal from Uruzgan province at the end of 2013, after a 12-year mission which saw 41 Defence Force personnel killed and 261 seriously wounded.

For exhibition today, we have a unit pool of Taliban fighters for use in Ambush Alley Games' Force on Force modern conflict rules system, and specifically with the Enduring Freedom Afghanistan supplement. These rural warriors, many of them veterans of the Soviet-Afghan war of the '80s, made their presence known in recent years resisting the presence of US forces in Afghanistan. (They make an appearance opposite the Tier-One Green Berets of EA's Medal of Honor -- check out our Green Berets here. Okay now come back.) A shot of the group: And now the eleven infantry teams, most of which include both a LMG and RPG: For support, a sniper team, extra LMG gunners, a DShKM HMG team, a Recoiless rifle team, and a mortar team: And finally, the elusive and dangerous Shadow Army -- representatives from Al Qaeda terrorist cells: All of these figures are from Elhiem Miniatures, and can double as Mujahideen in our Soviet-Afghan war project... but we'll save that for another time.

The attack combined a suicide car bomb with gunfire, killing 28 people and wounding at least 327. The attack comes with Afghanistan's government in total chaos, because of the bitter feud between President Ashraf Ghani and the country's chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah. Last week, US Secretary of State John Kerry made a surprise trip to Kabul to instruct Ghani, Abdullah, and the other the politicians on how to run their government. ( \"12-Apr-16 World View -- Troubles mount for Afghanistan government as US withdrawal looms\") Putting the best face on it, Ghani said the attack \"clearly shows the enemy's defeat in face-to-face battle with Afghan security forces.\" However, those results have clearly been fixed, with the Afghans scoring military successes in the northern part of the vast country, while the Taliban have been gaining ground in Helmand Province. For American policy and President Obama's administration, there is one major conundrum: Does the US continue its policy of withdrawing forces from Afghanistan, risking a total collapse in security as happened in Iraq? Or does the US reverse policy and add forces to Afghanistan, thus reneging on Obama's previous commitments? AP and Daily Times (Pakistan) and AFP China tests its DF-41 long-range nuclear missile with multiple warheads China conducted another flight test of its newest and longest-range intercontinental ballistic missile last week. The flight test of the new road-mobile DF-41 missile took place Tuesday with two multiple, independently targetable reentry vehicles, or MIRVs. This means that a single missile could deliver a nuclear weapon to two separate targets. As we wrote three weeks ago ( \"1-Apr-16 World View -- China close to deploying very long range DF-41 missile\"), it is believed that a fully-deployed DF-41 will be able to carry up to 10 MIRVs. A DF-41 can travel over the Pacific Ocean and strike any city in the western US, or travel over the North Pole and strike any city in the eastern US, in each case within about half an hour. China has the manufacturing capacity to produce hundreds of these missiles, and clearly is preparing for war and planning to use them. Washington Free Beacon Turkey threatens to cancel migrant deal unless visa restrictions are lifted by June Tensions are increasing quickly over a crucial provision of the EU-Turkey migrant deal, whose purpose is to slow the flow of migrants traveling from Turkey to Greece by means of a provision that permits Greece to return migrants back to Turkey. In return for the migrant deal, the EU made several commitments to Turkey: Visa liberalization: Turkish citizens will be able to travel in the EU without a visa by the end of June 2016. The EU will pay Turkey 3 billion euros in aid for refugees, disbursed as quickly as possible, followed possibly by another 3 billion. The EU was supposed to have already paid a portion of this aid, but hasn't. The EU and Turkey will \"reenergize the accession process\" to make Turkey a member of the European Union. The June deadline for visa-free travel is quickly approaching. On Monday, Turkey's prime minister Ahmed Davutoglu bluntly warned that the migrant deal will be off if visa liberalization is not implemented: This is a mutual commitment. If the EU cannot take the necessary steps required of it then of course it cannot be expected of Turkey to take these steps. I maintain my belief that, God willing, we will have the visa exemption in June. In the absence of that, then of course no one can expect Turkey to adhere to its commitments. Turkey must meet 72 criteria by May for the visa liberalization to be granted. Davutoglu says that 44 of the criteria have already been met, and the rest will be met by May. However, a new report by the European Parliament appears to contradict Davutoglu's claim. The report is extremely critical of the situation of basic rights and freedoms in Turkey. It is also heavily critical regarding a number of other significant issues, including the situation in Syria, rule of law, the situation with the armed Kurdish opposition, the negotiations on Cyprus, independence of the judiciary, freedom of assembly, freedom of expression and the normalization of relations with Armenia. Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan lashed out at the report: The European Union needs Turkey more than Turkey needs the European Union. Three million people have been looked after in this country so they don't disturb the Europeans. Is there anything about this in the report? At a time when our relations with the European Union are in a positive phase regarding the migrants... it is provocative to come out with a report like that. There is a great deal of opposition in the EU to visa-free travel by Turkish citizens, so this issue is expected to become a crisis next month. Hurriyet (Ankara) and Daily Sabah (Istanbul) and AFP Violence surges in Syria as 'peace talks' collapse becomes official \"Moderate\" rebel groups opposed to Syria's president Bashar al-Assad have once again said that they will not negotiate on a \"political solution\" unless al-Assad is to be removed from power. They made this official on Tuesday by pulling out of the Geneva peace talks. There was supposed to have been a cease-fire since February 27, but firing never actually ceased, and now violence is escalating sharply in several regions, especially around Aleppo, which the Syrian army is attempting to recapture from rebels with the help of massive airstrikes. Before the Russian military intervened last year, Syria's army was close to defeat for several reasons, but especially because of large numbers of defections and desertions. This situation has not changed, even with al-Assad's own Alawite sect. ( \"4-Apr-16 World View -- Syria's Alawites threaten to abandon Bashar al-Assad\") Now that much of Russia's military has withdrawn, there are reports that al-Assad's army is again losing ground in some regions. Al-Qaeda linked militias, the Islamic Party of Turkestan and Jund al-Aqsa, on Monday captured strategic positions in Syria's central province of Hama.

In a recent interview with the newspaper at the American Bagram Air Base, U.S. Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, indicated the new authorities have \"led to more aggressive targeting of insurgent leaders by U.S. and Afghan forces and helped Afghan's military shift to an offensive mindset.\" \"We're able to target critical nodes in the enemy organization and take out leaders and this has a significant impact,\" the general told USA Today on Sunday, warning that there was no \"silver bullet\" to defeat the Taliban. His comments appear to mark the first signs of progress against the terrorist group since Obama changed the rules of engagement (ROEs) in 2014, taking away the U.S. military's authority to offensively attack the Afghan Taliban. The changes came as the president ended the American combat mission in Afghanistan, Gen. John Campbell, Nicholson's predecessor, told lawmakers in February. On June 12, Gen. Nicholson told reporters in the Afghan capital of Kabul that the former rules allowed the U.S. military to respond to threats in \"a defensive, reactive kind of manner.\" \"Now, with the new authorities that we have now, as of June, we're able to then provide combat enablers to assist the Afghans who are now... taking the initiative against the enemy... so it's more of an offensive nature to that operation that we're assisting,\" he added. U.S. Secretary Ash Carter said the changes make \"very good sense.\" He explained: Whereas previously, he [Nicholson] waiting until a situation had developed in which the Afghan forces really needed our enabling support. Now, he's able to look ahead and see how the things are going on the battlefield and what the enemy's intentions are, where the enemy's massing and so forth and anticipate their movement rather than waiting until things turn into a situation in which our enabling support is much needed; try to head them off. That makes perfect common sense... this is a smarter way for us to give them [Afghans] that [military] help.\" Afghan security forces and civilians suffered a record number of casualties after the ROEs were altered. Moreover, Taliban jihadists had replaced their Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) rivals as the world's chief perpetrators of terrorist attacks (1,093) by the end of 2015 -- within nearly a year of the rule changes -- according to the U.S. State Department. While the U.S. military was permitted to offensively attack jihadists from al-Qaeda and the local Islamic State branch, the ROEs dealing with the Taliban were different. American forces were only able to attack the Taliban from a defensive position: when U.S. or allied troops, including Afghan partners, were under a direct threat and when U.S. officials believed the Taliban was providing direct support to its al-Qaeda allies. However, President Obama expanded the U.S. military's authority last month, allowing the American troops to strengthen Afghan offensives with American \"combat advisers, airstrikes, surveillance aircraft and pilots to fly alongside the fledgling Afghan air force,\" explained USA Today in late June. According to the newspaper, the changes also provided Gen. Nicholson with the sole authority to order the new missions. The new rules of engagement have made the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) more confident, declared the commander. \"We're seeing a shift in mindset,\" Nicholson told USA Today. \"They see the value of going on the offensive.\" USA Today quotes the top U.S. general as indicating that \"Afghan military leaders have told him their forces were more reactive last year, but they are now taking initiative in the fight against the Taliban and other insurgents, in part because of the expanded authority.\" Despite more than a decade of U.S. training and nearly $70 billion in American taxpayer funds invested in its development, the ANDSF, which includes police and army units, remains incapable of taking on Afghanistan's enemies on its own. Early this month, President Barack Obama announced that he plans to keep 8,400 troops in Afghanistan going into 2017 as he acknowledged that, after more than 14 years of war, \"the security situation in Afghanistan remains precarious.\" The president initially intended to reduce the U.S. military presence to 5,500 by the end of this year, from approximately 9,800 there now.

Khost, the sole village controlled by the government in Khak-e Safid district, was attacked by Taliban militants while the fight was ongoing, Humaira Ayubi, a member of parliament from the province, told dpa. Over 150 others are missing from the village, provincial council member, Abdul Samad Salehi, told dpa. Mr Salehi added that there was a contingent of 200 local policemen stationed in the village. He said militants had set fire to houses in the village. Ms Ayubi also said that the Taliban had attacked two to three police checkpoints on the outskirts of the city and had ransacked everything. She claimed that despite years of discussions with the government about the deteriorating security situation of the province, authorities have yet to listen and increase the number of troops. Ms Ayubi said that Farah's security situation is very fragile and save for the provincial capital Farah city, every other district is currently controlled by the Taliban. In mid-May, Taliban militants overrun parts of Farah city, battling Afghan forces for control, for days. Earlier, at least 25 Afghan security personnel were killed in a Taliban attack on a military base in the province on November 6.

(John Moore/Getty Images)MOREHIDE International donate President Trump Says US Determined to Win War in Afghanistan By Jasper Fakkert August 21, 2017 Updated: August 25, 2017 President Donald Trump said the United States is committed to winning the war in Afghanistan and preventing the same errors that were made in the withdrawal from Iraq from happening again. Speaking at Fort Myer in Virginia, Trump said that he shared the American people's frustration with the 16-year-long war in Afghanistan--America's longest. He had initially wanted to pull out of Afghanistan completely, he said, thinking that America had spent too much time trying to rebuild other nations in its image, instead of focusing on its own security. However, Trump said that after ordering a comprehensive review of all options in Afghanistan, and studying the situation in great detail, he changed his mind. He said that America deserves to have an honorable outcome of the conflict, one worthy of the sacrifices made by those who have been killed in the war, and that America's troops \"deserve a plan for victory.\" Afghan security force personnel take part in an operation against an ISIS terrorist stronghold in Nangarhar Province, eastern Afghanistan, on April 14. (PHOTO BY GETTY IMAGES) A rapid withdraw from America's remaining troops in Afghanistan could create a vacuum that terrorist groups such as ISIS and al-Qaeda could rapidly fill, similarly to what happened in Iraq. Following the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, ISIS and other terror groups gained a foothold. \"We cannot repeat in Afghanistan the mistakes our leaders made in Iraq,\" Trump said. Trump also highlighted concern over the large number of terror groups currently active in Afghanistan, and its close proximity to Pakistan, which has given safe haven to such groups. \"America and our partners are committed to stripping terrorists of their territory, cutting off their funding, and exposing the false allure of their evil ideology,\" Trump said. \"Terrorists who slaughter innocent people will find no glory in this life or the next. They are nothing but thugs and criminals and predators, and, that's right, losers.\" Trump promised that America would work with its allies in breaking the terror groups' will and eventually defeating them. War Strategy Repeating what he said during the presidential campaign, Trump said he believes announcing timetables of troop deployment and withdrawal is counterproductive. Instead, the president said that he would not announce plans for troop increases and that \"conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables, will guide our strategy from now on.\" \"I will not say when we are going to attack, but attack we will,\" he said. After troop levels reached their peak at around 100,000 troops in 2010 under the Obama administration, President Barack Obama sharply reduced troop levels to less than 10,000 in 2016. The reduction in troop levels was first announced by Obama in 2011. At the time, Obama said that the United States was meeting its goal of training Afghan security forces to defend their own country. But despite years of training and billions spent, Afghan security forces have proven unable to effectively fight and push back the Taliban while still relying heavily on U.S. intelligence and combat support.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Trump said that he would combine the pillars of American power--diplomatic, economic, and military--to work toward a successful outcome for Afghanistan. He also opened the possibility for elements of the Taliban to be part of a successfull settlement, but said that \"nobody knows if or when that will ever happen.\" The president also said he would ensure that U.S. troops had the conditions to defeat the enemy. \"I have already lifted restrictions the previous administration placed on our war fighters that prevented the secretary of defense and our commanders in the field from fully and swiftly waging battle against the enemy,\" Trump said. No Micromanagement In the campaign against ISIS, Trump has shown that he does not believe micromanagement from Washington wins battles. He is following the same principle with Afghanistan. In June this year, Trump had already given the secretary of defense the power to set troop levels for Afghanistan.

(MARK WILSON/GETTY IMAGES) Trump's announcement comes following a meeting with his national security team at the Camp David presidential retreat last week. Defense Secretary James Mattis has said he was pleased with the process that the administration went through. \"These troops go in harm's way, so you have to be careful,\" Mattis said last month, explaining why he had not yet used the authority to increase troop levels given to him by the president in June. In every generation, we have faced down evil, and we have always prevailed.-- President Donald Trump Trump said that he plans to further expand the authority of the armed forces to target terrorists and criminal networks in Afghanistan. \"Our troops will fight to win. We will fight to win. From now on, victory will have a clear definition: attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing al-Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge,\" he said. Trump said that America will work with the Afghan government and that it is not in the business of nation building anymore. \"We are not asking others to change their way of life, but to pursue common goals that allow our children to live better and safer lives,\" he said. U.S. soldiers patrol in the Achin district of Afghanistan's Nangarhar Province on April 15. (PHOTO BY GETTY IMAGES) However, Trump did say that America's support for the Afghan government \"is not a blank check\" and that \"our patience is not unlimited.\" Trump also urged America to unite and to defend it from enemies abroad. \"In every generation, we have faced down evil, and we have always prevailed,\" he said. Making reference to divisions within America, and implicitly to the violent protest that broke out in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12, Trump called on the nation to unite. \"When we open our hearts to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice, no place for bigotry, and no tolerance for hate,\" he said. \"The young men and women we send to fight our wars abroad deserve to return to a country that is not at war with itself at home. We cannot remain a force for peace in the world if we are not at peace with each other.\" An Ongoing War The war in Afghanistan has dragged on for nearly 16 years, at a cost of more than 2,400 American lives. The war began in 2001 in an effort to topple a power base of the al-Qaeda terrorist group. The United States and its allies have since tried to establish a democratic government in the country, which has many remote, rural areas and strong tribal divisions, while fighting the Taliban.

(STR/AFP/Getty Images) Some regions have been freed from Taliban control, only to later be retaken by the Islamist extremists--a process that has often repeated itself multiple times in a single area. Just on Aug. 14, the Taliban took control of the district of Ghormach in Badghis Province, for the third time. According to The Long War Journal, the Taliban took the district center in October 2015 before Afghan forces recaptured it a week later, and again for a short period in October 2016. So far this year, 11 U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan, according to icasualties.org. The highest number of casualties in a single year was 499 in 2010, with 368 deaths as a result of improvised explosive devices. Joshua Philipp contributed to this report.

Afghanistan, on Sept. 26, 2008. (STR/AFP/Getty Images) February 14, 2018 By Reuters KABUL--The Taliban said on Wednesday, in a rare statement to the American people, they wanted to end Afghanistan's 17-year war through talks, while warning the message should not be seen as a sign of weakness and the fight against U.S. forces would go on. A more aggressive U.S. strategy in Afghanistan including a surge in air strikes introduced by President Donald Trump in August has pushed the Taliban back from several district centers and two provincial capitals. U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks on Americas military involvement in Afghanistan at the Fort Myer military base on Aug. 21, 2017 in Arlington, Virginia. Trump announced a modest increase in troop levels in Afghanistan, the result of a growing concern by the Pentagon over setbacks on the battlefield for the Afghan military against Taliban and al-Qaeda forces. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) But the Taliban control large parts of the countryside and have responded to the more aggressive U.S. strategy with two attacks in Kabul in the past few weeks, killing nearly 150 people. The attacks have toughened both the U.S. and Afghan governments' stand against initiating talks with the Taliban, although neither side seems capable of winning the conflict. \"Our preference is to solve the Afghan issue through peaceful dialogue,\" the Taliban said. The Taliban, fighting to oust foreign forces and defeat the U.S.-backed government, said the United States must end its \"occupation\" and accept the Taliban right to form a government \"consistent with the beliefs of our people.\" In their statement, the Taliban did not mention a Jan. 27 raid on a top Kabul hotel, in which more than 30 people were killed, nor a bomb attack on a crowded street a week later that killed more than 100. They claimed both attacks. Afghan volunteers carry bodies at the scene of a car bomb exploded in front of the old Ministry of Interior building in Kabul on Jan. 27, 2018. An ambulance packed with explosives blew up in a crowded area of Kabul on Jan. 27, killing at least 17 people and wounding 110 others, officials said, in an attack claimed by the Taliban. (WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP/Getty Images) The Taliban only mentioned the Afghan government to deride it on various grounds. A government spokesman declined to comment on the statement. 'Louder Than Words' A spokesman for Afghanistan's NATO-led military mission said the recent Taliban attacks on civilians demonstrated they were not ready to enter \"good-faith peace negotiations\" while the government had on numerous occasions made clear it was willing to begin a peace process. \"The Taliban statement alone does not show willingness to engage in peace talks. The recent attacks speak louder than these words,\" said the spokesman, Captain Tom Gresback. The Taliban said it was not too late for the American people to realize the Taliban can solve problems with every side \"through healthy politics and dialogue\", adding the chances for dialogue were \"not exhausted.\" Preliminary talks on ending the war that kills thousands of people each year have stalled. But low-level contacts between the government, international groups including the United Nations and groups close to the Taliban have continued even as the insurgency has escalated. Progress has been blocked by the deep mistrust between the government and the Taliban, as well as uncertainty about the role of neighbors including Pakistan, which Afghanistan has long accused of aiding the insurgents. Pakistan rejects accusations that it sponsors the Taliban. The Taliban said their willingness to play a \"constructive role in finding a peaceful solution\" should not be taken as a sign of weakness. \"This can never mean that we are exhausted or our will has been sapped,\" they said. They said they had no intention to damage any other country or let anyone use Afghan territory against anyone else.

The statement of the Taliban says that ISIL - \"this group of modern Kharijites (apostates - ed.), cruel atheists and mercenaries sows discord and enmity,tries to destroy the unity of Sunnis, Shiites and Ismailis Afghanistan, inciting against each other, kills theologians and discredits the sacred religion of Islam before the world.\" In a statement led by Afghan media, it is noted that the reason for the declaration of the war was the capture by the IS militants of Darzab county in Jawzjan province, where \"the Kharijit group\" tried to expand its sphere of influence by beheading the gravest crimes and beheaded 20 captured Mujahideen.\" The Taliban movement calls on all its supporters \"to repay them on merit and revenge for the Mujahideen from now on in all points of Afghanistan,\" the report said. At the same time, the authorities of Jawzjan province in the north-west of Afghanistan announced on Saturday the liquidation of two IGIL fighters, one of whom was a citizen of Uzbekistan, as a result of NATO air strikes. Another three \"Glovis\" - all citizens of Uzbekistan - were detained, press secretary of the Governor of the province Mohammad Reza Gafuri told journalists on Saturday. The authorities of the province note that within two months during operations in the province, 20 IGIL fighters were arrested, more than 50 members of the group were killed and wounded. 1.3kON SHARESShareTweetSubscribe Loading...

U.S. Gen. John Nicholson dismissed the reports as a mischaracterization of his comments, stressing in a statement issued Monday that United States policy remains focused on supporting peace talks led by the U.S.-allied Kabul government. The statement came after Reuters reported Monday that Nicholson had indicated that \"the United States is ready to join direct negotiations with the Taliban in an effort to end the 17 year-long war in Afghanistan ... amid growing speculation about possible peace talks.\" Addressing the alleged mischaracterization of his remarks, Nicholson, the outgoing commander of the U.S.-NATO mission in Afghanistan, declared: The United States is not a substitute for the Afghan people or the Afghan government. My reaffirmation of Secretary [Mike] Pompeo's statement in which he said peace talks would include a discussion of international forces and that the United States is ready to work with the Taliban, the Afghan government and the Afghan people towards lasting peace was mischaracterized. The United States is exploring \"all avenues\" to advance a peace process, \"but this remains an Afghan-led process,\" U.S. Army Lt. Col. Martin O'Donnell, a spokesman for the American-NATO mission in Afghanistan known as Resolute Support, added. In a June 16 statement, Secretary Pompeo stressed that the United States is against the Taliban's long-held precondition of a complete withdrawal of foreign forces for peace talks to occur but noted that everything, including the presence of U.S.-NATO-led troops, is up for discussion. On Sunday, the New York Times (NYT), citing unnamed senior American and Afghan officials, reported that the Trump administration has ordered \"its top diplomats to seek direct talks with the Taliban,\" marking a significant shift in U.S. policy long sought by the terrorist group. NYT acknowledged that neither the U.S. State Department nor the Afghan Taliban had confirmed a shift in policy, adding, \"While no date for any talks has been set, and the effort could still be derailed, the willingness of the United States to pursue direct talks is an indication of the sense of urgency in the administration to break the stalemate in Afghanistan.\" The United States has long insisted that peace talks must be owned and led by Kabul, but the Taliban, which wants to directly negotiate the end of the war with the U.S., has refused to budge on the issue. Trump administration officials have made \"reconciliation\" between the Taliban and Kabul the primary goal of its strategy to end the war. Diplomatic efforts towards peace negotiations have intensified since an unprecedented three-day ceasefire between the two warring sides last month, credited by Kabul and Washington to U.S. President Donald Trump's Afghan strategy unveiled in August 2017. Opium cultivation, heroin production, and the Taliban's territory and manpower reached record levels under the previous U.S. administration. There has been a \"slight increase\" in territory controlled by terrorist groups, mainly the Taliban, in Afghanistan since President Trump took office, the U.S. Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a watchdog agency appointed by Congress, reported at the end of April. Nearly a year after the U.S. president released his Afghan plan, the war remains locked in a stalemate, according to various assessments.

The hardline Sunni Taliban is an export from Pakistan into Afghanistan around 1994, to counter the Soviet Union's aggression. They are NOT the same as al-Qaeda. After the attacks on 9/11, President Bush and the press seem to conflate the two groups by indicating that al-Qaeda was responsible for the US bombings but that the Taliban provided them shelter in Afghanistan. The impression was created in the minds of the public that the Taliban and Al-Qaeda were the same terrorist entity. Mullah-Omar-former/ deceased Taliban leader This belief of the Taliban and al-Qaeda being intertwined together, came to be accepted even though the Taliban played no role in the 9/11 attacks, had no prior knowledge of the attacks and that they publicly condemned the actions by al-Qaeda. The two groups are very different in their ideologies, goals, backgrounds, ethnicity, culture and history. The US military was successful in defeating al-Qaeda for at least a temporary period of time. As the US military started pulling out of Afghanistan in 2014, the Taliban who had been in nearby Pakistan since 2001, after being previously pushed out by the US military, were able to return to Afghanistan to take over to enforce an extreme form of sharia law. Afghanistan Map Originally they were welcomed by Afghan tribal leaders (mostly Sunni) because they promised to provide peace and stability. The honeymoon period did not last long. Their strict adherence to Sharia law includes stoning, cutting off of hands, honor killings, and no girls attending school after the age of 10. This is too extreme for many Afghans even though a 2013 Pew Poll shows that 99% of the population approve of making Sharia the official law of their country. Ahmad Shah Massoud, Military hero, Defense Minister of Afghanistan; Lion of Panjshir. He was ordered assassinated by Osama Bin Laden 9/9/2001 because he was considered a dangerous opponent. The current problem in 2015, is that the Taliban are aggressively fighting for control for areas in Afghanistan. The Afghanistan military after years of training by the US military with financial support, do not seem able to adequately defend themselves. This is partly because these Taliban groups have homes and a base in nearby Pakistan. A counter insurgency operation cannot succeed while the insurgents are provided a nearby safe haven where they can refresh, re-supply re-equip and add recruits. The Pakistan leaders vehemently deny this but they are dissembling. The US has to face up to this fact by confronting Pakistan directly on this issue, so that the Afghans can have a fair chance to be successful at self governing. Pakistan Taliban BBC News tackled the subject of \"Who are the Taliban with the following 9/29/15 historical chronology of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan and Pakistan: \"The hardline Islamic (Sunni) Taliban movement has proved to be a formidable fighting force in Afghanistan and a major threat to its government.\" Taliban \"The Taliban also threatens to destabilise Pakistan, where they control areas in the north-west and have been blamed for a wave of suicide bombings and other attacks.\" \"Many observers now believe that future peace in Afghanistan can only come if the government in Kabul negotiates with the Taliban.\" \"The announcement of Taliban plans to open an office in Qatar in June 2013 was seen as a positive step in those negotiations, but mistrust on both sides remains high.\" \"Despite this, talks between the Taliban and Afghan government officials took place for the first time in July 2015.\" (The talks fell apart when the Taliban refused to continue until ALL US military left Afghanistan.) Taliban fighters \"Those talks came a month after a group of Afghan women met Taliban representatives in Oslo.\" \"In September 2015, the Afghan Taliban said they had put aside weeks of infighting and rallied around a new leader in the form of Mullah Mansour, who had been the deputy of longstanding leader Mullah Omar.\" \"The previous month the Taliban admitted they had covered up Mullah Omar's death for more than two years.\" Austere rule \"The Taliban emerged in the early 1990s in northern Pakistan following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.\" Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani \"A predominantly Pashtun movement, the Taliban came to prominence in Afghanistan in the autumn of 1994.\" \"It is commonly believed that they first appeared in religious seminaries - mostly paid for by money from Saudi Arabia - which preached a hard line form of Sunni Islam.\" \"The Taliban's promise - in Pashtun areas straddling Pakistan and Afghanistan - was to restore peace and security and enforce their own austere version of Sharia, or Islamic law, once in power.\" Missing Artifact Buddha, vandalized by Taliban \"In both countries they introduced or supported Islamic punishments - such as public executions of convicted murderers and adulterers and amputations of those found guilty of theft.\" \"Men were required to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka.\" \"The Taliban banned television, music and cinema and disapproved of girls aged 10 and over from going to school.\" Taliban turning in weapons as part of amnesty program THE TALIBAN \"Pakistan has repeatedly denied that it is the architect of the Taliban enterprise.\" \"But there is little doubt that many Afghans who initially joined the movement were educated in madrassas (religious schools) in Pakistan.\" \"Pakistan was also one of only three countries, along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which recognised the Taliban when they were in power in Afghanistan from the mid-1990s until 2001.\" \"It was also the last country to break diplomatic ties with the Taliban.\" Malala Yousafzai \"Although Pakistan has in recent years adopted a harder line against Taliban militants carrying out attacks on its soil, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif - who was elected in May 2013 - has said talking to the militants is one of his priorities.\" \"At least three key leaders of the Pakistani Taliban were killed in US drone strikes in 2013. Mullah Nazir was killed in January and Waliur Rehman was killed in May.\" \"In November 2013, the group's leader in Pakistan, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a drone strike.\" \"But despite these setbacks for the militants, there is evidence that their influence in Karachi has significantly increased.\" Child in a training camp \"What is arguably one of the most internationally criticised of all Pakistani Taliban attacks took place in October 2012, when schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai was attacked on her way home in the town of Mingora.\" Al-Qaeda 'sanctuary' \"The attention of the world was drawn to the Taliban in Afghanistan following the attacks on the World Trade Centre in September 2001.\" The Taliban in Afghanistan were accused of providing a sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda movement who were blamed for the attacks. \"Soon after 9/11 the Taliban were driven from power in Afghanistan by a US-led coalition, although their leader Mullah Mohammad Omar was not captured.\" Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Pakistan \"In recent years the Taliban have re-emerged in Afghanistan and grown far stronger in Pakistan, where observers say there is loose co-ordination between different Taliban factions and militant groups.\" \"The main Pakistani faction was led by \"until his death. His Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is blamed for dozens of suicide bombings and other attacks.\" \"Observers warn against over-stating the existence of one unified insurgency against the Pakistani state, however.\" \"For years the Taliban in Afghanistan were led by Mullah Omar, a village clergyman who lost his right eye fighting the occupying forces of the Soviet Union in the 1980s.\" \"Afghans, weary of the mujahideen's excesses and infighting after the Soviets were driven out, generally welcomed the Taliban when they first appeared on the scene.\" \"Their early popularity was largely due to their success in stamping out corruption, curbing lawlessness and making the roads and the areas under their control safe for commerce to flourish.\" Taliban US onslaught \"From south-western Afghanistan, the Taliban quickly extended their influence.\" \"They captured the province of Herat, bordering Iran, in September 1995.\" \"Exactly one year later, they captured the Afghan capital, Kabul, after overthrowing the regime of President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his defence minister, Ahmed Shah Massoud.\" \"By 1998, they were in control of almost 90% of Afghanistan.\" American soldiers cross the Tarnak river. (AP Photo/Sgt. Kimberly Hackbarth, U.S. Army) They were accused of various human rights and cultural abuses. One notorious example was in 2001, when the Taliban went ahead with the destruction of the famous Bamiyan Buddha statues in central Afghanistan, despite international outrage. On October 7, 2001, a US-led military coalition invaded Afghanistan and by the first week of December the Taliban regime had collapsed. Taliban talks \"Mullah Omar and his comrades have evaded capture despite one of the largest manhunts in the world.\" (Afghan leaders are stating that Mullah Omar died in 2013. ) \"They are generally thought to be taking refuge in the Pakistani city of Quetta, from where they are guiding the resurgent Taliban.\" \"But the existence of what is dubbed the \"Quetta Shura\" is denied by Islamabad.\" Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai (R) and China's President Xi Jinping October 28, 2014. REUTERS/Jason Lee \"Despite ever higher numbers of foreign troops, the Taliban have steadily extended their influence, rendering vast tracts of Afghanistan insecure, and violence in the country has returned to levels not seen since 2001.\" Their retreat earlier this decade enabled them to limit their human and material losses and return with a vengeance.\" \"There have been numerous Taliban attacks on Kabul in recent years and, in September 2012, the group carried out a high profile raid on NATO's Camp Bastion base.\" Abdul-Aziz- Pakistan-Muslim-Cleric-says-fight-against-Taliban-is-un-Islamic \"In the same month the US military handed control of the controversial Bagram prison - housing more than 3,000 Taliban fighters and terrorism suspects - to the Afghan authorities.\" \"In September 2015 the Taliban seized control of a provincial capital for the first time since their defeat in 2001, taking control of the strategically important city of Kunduz.\"(Kunduz is where Doctors without Borders Hospital was bombed by US air strikes on 10/3/15. Twenty two people were killed. US is admitting fault.) The US is keeping close to 10,000 troops in Afghanistan throughout 2015, but the Taliban finds itself an increasingly splintered organization - that is also threatened by the rise of the so-called Islamic State militant group in Afghanistan.\" RELATED ARTICLE: the illusion of governance - Defense Technical Information ... http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/ by JJ Mendoza - 2013 - Related articles May 22, 2013 - its border with the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan (DAT- ... system of governance powered by bribes...

He said Pakistani Taliban chief Mullah Fazlullah appointed a commander called Mufti Noor Wali Wali to replace their dead deputy. Mehsud, also known as Sajna, was killed along with his nephew and two guards, according to The Express Tribune. \"The vehicle was completely destroyed,\" an intelligence official told the Pakistani publication. #Taliban confirms death of deputy leader Khalid Mehsud https://t.co/jXe9yuR3FA -- Agenda Of Evil (@AgendaOfEvil) February 12, 2018 Mehsud, who had two wives and belonged to the Shobi Khel tribe, was placed on the U.S. Designated Terrorist list in October 2014, according to the Express Tribune. Wali, according to Reuters, will now train militants in South Waziristan, a rugged mountainous region on the Afghan border which has long been home to Pakistani, Afghan, and al Qaeda-linked foreign militants. Militant sources said Wali, known by the nickname Ghar Starga, is a ruthless leader with experience working in Pakistani urban areas including the southern city of Karachi.

The Pakistani military mounted a major offensive against the militants in 2014, forcing many of them to withdraw into Afghanistan. The border region is off limits to journalists and verifying information independently is difficult. Reuters contributed to this report.

Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, revealed \"the presence of relations and new [links] with Iran,\" reports Asharq Al-Awsat. However, he denied reports that the Taliban has appointed a representative in Iran. \"The movement is trying to benefit from all legitimate means to reach a regional agreement as part of the war against the American invasion; therefore, the Imara [Taliban] holds ongoing [links] with a large number of regional and neighboring states,\" added the spokesman, referring to the relationship between the Taliban and Iran. While briefing Pentagon reporters on October 21, American Brig. Gen. Charles Cleveland, a top spokesman for the U.S.-NATO mission in Afghanistan, said that the ultimate goal of the coalition is a \"negotiated solution with the Taliban,\" rather than defeating the terrorist group. Iran has been accused of providing deadly military assistance to the Taliban in its fight against the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan. Some analysts, including experts at the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War, believe that opposition to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan has fueled the ongoing links between the Taliban and Iran. At the end of May, various news outlets reported that mutual disdain towards the Sunni Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) had pulled the Afghan Taliban and Iran closer. The ties between Iran and the Afghan Taliban have reportedly evolved into an effort to prevent the ISIS branch known as the Khorasan Province (IS-K/ISIL-KP) from flourishing in the region. Khorasan is an ancient word for the territory that primarily covers Afghanistan and Pakistan but also parts of Iran, India, and other neighboring countries. Iran has also been affiliated with al-Qaeda, a Taliban ally. Taliban spokesman Mujahid also told Asharq Al-Awsat that the terrorist group is seeking to establish relations with Sunni Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional enemy. \"Our religious shrines are there, and therefore this state has a big responsibility towards the Muslim world and their issues,\" noted Mujahid when commenting on Taliban peace discussions between Saudi leaders and their Afghan counterparts, namely Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani and the country's Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah. \"We seek to have a lasting and good relationship with the government and people of Saudi Arabia,\" added the spokesman. According to Asharq Al-Awsat and other news outlets, Mujahid has denied reports the Taliban recently held informal, secret peace talks with the U.S.-backed Afghan government. Two Taliban officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the terrorist group met with the Afghan government in Qatar earlier this month. U.S. officials played a role in the negotiation process, added the Taliban members, without specifying whether the Americans directly participated in the talks. \"There were no such meetings. We reject any secret negotiations with representatives of the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. There is no truth to such reports,\" the Taliban spokesman told Asharq Al-Awsat.

Federal Disorganization Blamed For Slow Release Of Soldier Held By Taliban April 24, 2014 at 4:49 amFiled Under:Bowe Bergdahl, Taliban(FILES) This file photo taken on September 26, 2008 shows fighters with Afghanistan's Taliban militia standing on a hillside at Maydan Shahr in Wardak province, west of Kabul. World powers supported Afghan President Hamid Karzai's plan to woo moderate Taliban fighters who disarm, as it emerged that senior figures in the Islamist militia held secret talks with UN officials. While leaders meeting in London to discuss the war-shattered country agreed to back a multimillion-dollar fund for militants who lay down their arms, a UN official said UN envoy Kai Eide had met Taliban members in Dubai January 2010. AFP PHOTO / FILES (Photo credit should read STR/AFP/Getty Images)Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. (credit: STR/AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON -- The captors of an American soldier held for nearly five years in Afghanistan have signaled a willingness to release him but are unclear which U.S. government officials have the authority to make a deal, according to two individuals in the military working for his release. Critics of the release effort blame disorganization and poor communication among the numerous federal agencies involved. An ever-shrinking U.S. military presence in Afghanistan has refocused attention on efforts to bring home Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who has been held by the Taliban since June 30, 2009. About two dozen officials at the State and Defense departments, the military's U.S. Central Command, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Special Operations Command, the CIA and FBI are working the case -- most of them doing it alongside their other duties, a defense official said. Bergdahl's captors are anxious to release him, according to a defense official and a military officer, who both spoke to The Associated Press only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case publicly. \"Elements in all echelons -- from the top of the Taliban down to the folks holding Bergdahl -- are reaching out to make a deal,\" the defense official said. The military officer, who said the effort was marred by distrust on both sides, said those holding Bergdahl have indicated what they would be willing to do to prove to the U.S. government that they want to deal, but that the U.S. has not formally responded to that outreach. Bergdahl, 28, of Hailey, Idaho, was last seen in a \"proof of life\" video released in December. He is thought to be held by members of the Haqqani network, which operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and has been one of the deadliest threats to U.S. troops in the war. The Haqqani network, which the State Department designated as a foreign terrorist organization in 2012, claims allegiance to the Afghan Taliban, yet operates with some degree of autonomy. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., wrote earlier this year to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, saying it was critical that efforts to free Bergdahl are not overcome by bureaucracy. \"Given the significance and necessity for centralized command and control, which I have been informed is little to nonexistent, I urge you to seriously consider the idea of directing an individual to organize, manage and coordinate activity that involves multiple elements of the federal government working toward Bergdahl's release,\" wrote Hunter, a Marine veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan. Days later, Hagel appointed Michael Lumpkin, assistant defense secretary for special operations and low-intensity conflict, as the point person for the Bergdahl case at the Pentagon. Hunter viewed that as a good step but noted that Lumpkin only has jurisdiction over the Pentagon work, not the other agencies. A month after Lumpkin's appointment, Hunter wrote President Barack Obama, asking him to make the Defense Department the lead on all efforts to get Bergdahl back \"with the specific aim of achieving a faster resolution than can be provided by the Department of State.\" He also asked Obama to name one coordinator to oversee the entire Bergdahl effort. The State Department is leading the most publicized approach to getting Bergdahl back -- a plan to exchange him for five Taliban detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The department declined comment on Hunter's letters and referred questions to the White House. \"The reason Sgt. Bergdahl remains a captive is because he is being held by a terrorist organization, not because of a lack of effort or coordination by the U.S. government,\" said Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council. The defense official and military officer paint a different picture. When the Hagel's office and CENTCOM separately learned about the Bergdahl video in December, there was confusion about who should tell the family, the defense official said. The secretary's office ended up informing the family. That angered CENTCOM, which believed it was its responsibility to tell the Bergdahls. Neither was communicating with the other about the video notification, the defense official said. In August 2012, Obama contacted Bergdahl's parents weeks after they expressed frustration that the government wasn't doing enough to secure their son's freedom. But in May 2013, Bob Bergdahl told a POW/MIA gathering in Washington that he was pleased with the government's efforts to bring his son home. Navy Cmdr. Amy Derrick-Frost, a Defense Department spokeswoman, also defended the effort, saying the Pentagon was committed to the safe and immediate release of Bergdahl and saying Lumpkin was spearheading the \"comprehensive synchronization\" of efforts throughout the department and with other agencies. The Pentagon is exploring several avenues to get Bergdahl released, including one that seeks to negotiate with the Haqqani network, according to an individual familiar with the government's efforts. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss the Pentagon's efforts, said some government officials also are looking into ways to seek the simultaneous release of Bergdahl and four civilians, including a woman who was pregnant when she went missing, believed held by militants. All avenues are fraught with difficulties. In late February, the Taliban said they had suspended \"mediation\" with the United States about swapping Bergdahl for the five Taliban detainees, blaming the \"current complex political situation\" in Afghanistan. There also is some congressional opposition to the prisoner swap. According to military documents, one of the five served as interior minister during the Taliban's five-year rule of Afghanistan and had direct ties to Osama bin Laden. \"That's dead,\" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said when asked about the prison swap idea. \"It hasn't gone anywhere for a couple of years.\" McCain, who was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for more than five years, also said Obama administration officials first told Congress that they wanted to release five Taliban detainees at Guantanamo as a confidence-building measure to jump-start talks with the Taliban. \"I said that was insane ... to do that,\" said McCain, a frequent critic of the Obama administration who believes the government's approach to getting Bergdahl back is in disarray. \"Then it was the swap for Bergdahl. I said, 'OK, fine. How are you going to do that?' They never explained anything to anybody about how it would be done. ... How can you get him back if you are totally disorganized?\" More Political News Tim Kaine Projected To Win Re-Election To U.S. Senate In VirginiaMaryland Democrats Seek To Ride In 'Blue Wave' On Election NightGov.

PHOTO: AFP KUNDUZ, AFGHANISTAN: Foreign fighters allied with the Islamic State group are training Taliban insurgents in a restive Afghan province, an official said Friday, the first such claim as the government raises the alarm over an emerging IS threat. President Ashraf Ghani has repeatedly raised fears that IS -- notorious for their brutal reign of terror in Syria and Iraq -- are making steady inroads into Afghanistan, which is already in the grip of a fierce Taliban insurgency. But the governor of Kunduz, the scene of intense fighting for two weeks that has displaced thousands, has gone further by claiming that the two groups are joining forces in the northern Afghan province. Read: Afghan Taliban link reconciliation with complete withdrawal of foreign troops IS fighters are \"supporting the Taliban, training the Taliban, trying to build the capacity of the Taliban for a bigger fight\", provincial governor Mohammed Omar Safi told the BBC. Local observers have viewed claims of IS's rise in Afghanistan with caution. The Middle Eastern group has never formally acknowledged a presence in Afghanistan and most self-styled IS insurgents in the country are believed to be Taliban turncoats rebranding themselves to appear as a more lethal force. The two groups, which espouse different ideological strains of Sunni Islam, are believed to be arrayed against each other in Afghanistan's restive south, with clashes frequently reported. But the governor insisted that the fight is different in the once-tranquil north, which has recently seen a huge influx of foreign fighters from countries such as Chechnya, Pakistan and Tajikistan. Read: Will Kabul's talks with the Afghan Taliban succeed? \"In the worst affected Imam Sahib district, (IS) fighters are training and supporting local Taliban fighters to raise their capacity... in their fight against the Afghan government,\" the governor's spokesman Abdul Wadood Wahidi told AFP. Last month hundreds of militants came within six kilometres (3.7 miles) of Kunduz city just hours after the Taliban launched their annual spring offensive, in the most serious threat to any provincial capital since the US-led 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. The insurgents have since been pushed back after Afghan reinforcements were brought in from other frontlines, but the fighting still continues to rage on the fringes of the city. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced due to the clashes, with aid agencies warning of dire living conditions for those who have fled their homes and moved to the city centre. \"Around 14,000 families have been displaced in two weeks of ongoing fighting in Kunduz,\" Ghulam Sakhi, an administrator in the Kunduz refugees department, told AFP. \"Our teams have surveyed 600 families and have distributed food items and blankets, mattresses and kitchen kits.\" Read: Kabul-backed peace council to meet with Afghan Taliban at Qatar conference Afghan government forces are preparing for a fresh offensive to flush out insurgents from the outlying areas of the city, officials said. President Ghani has warned that IS poses a serious threat to regional security, warning that the group was more than lethal than Al-Qaeda. \"With all apologies to Microsoft, if Al-Qaeda was Windows One, Daesh is Windows Five,\" he told reporters recently, alluding to the Arabic acronym for IS. But some local observers accuse him of grabbing world attention by playing up the IS threat in the face of dwindling foreign aid and as international troops depart. \"Daesh have a limited number of fighters in Afghanistan,\" Mia Gul Waseeq, Afghan political and security analyst, told AFP. \"But they are trying to grow their influence in Afghanistan, training and supporting the Afghan Taliban in their ranks who swore allegiance to them.\" Read more: Afghanistan , Daesh , IS Read full story Recommended Stories Afghan delegation to meet with Taliban in Qatar: officialsTaliban's attendance \"does not mean peace talks or negotiations at all,\" the Taliban's spokesperson cautions Pakistan supports 'talks' between Afghan govt, Taliban in Qatar: Aizaz ChaudhryAfghan delegation left for Qatar to hold two days of \"open discussion\" with TalibanQatar dialogue: Pakistan urges Afghan Taliban to pursue talksForeign secretary says Islamabad supports any formal or informal dialogue that leads to reconciliation in Afghanistan Facebook Conversations Reader Comments (1) All Comments Reader's Recommendations unbelievable May 8, 2015 - 6:39PM Reply IS involvement will backfire - they are foreigners who treat locals poorly.

News The Taliban on Monday directed Afghans to boycott upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for October 20, as they ramp up attacks in strategic provinces. The Taliban also demanded a complete withdrawal of foreign forces as the only solution to end the 17-year-old war. The statement from the hard-line Islamic militant group coincided with the visit of top U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been appointed to lead peace efforts with the Taliban. Mr Khalilzad met President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul to strategise ways to hold Afghan-led peace talks with the Taliban, whose 1996-2001 rule was ended by U.S.-led troops. \"Peace is a holy process, and the U.S. government and people are united with the Afghan government and people in this process,\" Mr Khalilzad was quoted by Ghani's office in a statement as saying. Mr Khalilzad, an Afghan-born former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq, joined the U.S. State Department team in September. He is scheduled to visit Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar this week as he seeks to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table. Meanwhile, the Taliban, who are fighting to expel foreign forces, topple the government, and restore their version of hard-line Islamic law, have repeatedly rejected offers to hold peace talks or support the polls. The October 20 vote, seen by international partners as a dry run for presidential elections in 2019, has been hampered by chaotic preparations, allegations of fraud and ever-present fears of militant violence. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban's main spokesman, said the U.S. was using the elections for the sole purpose of legitimising their presence and authority. \"People are given a deceptive feeling of having free right casting their votes for the malicious purpose of minimising their resentment against the foreign occupation,\" he said. With less than two weeks to go before the long-delayed elections, the Taliban and Islamic State have ramped up attacks across the country. The fighting has underlined the struggle security forces face as the insurgents have steadily extended their control over the countryside even though they have been unable to take and hold a major city. \"The real solution of the ongoing Afghan crisis lies in the complete withdrawal of all foreign occupying forces and the restoration of a pure Islamic sovereignty,\" Mr Mujahid said. Western diplomats have said the fighting raises questions about the viability of the U.S. strategy to end the war, which has focused on forcing the militants, largely with more air strikes, to the negotiating table.

Around 20 others were wounded and 16 were taken hostage after hours of fighting in Qaisar district on Monday, Sayed Hashemi, a Provincial Council Member, said. He said four bodies were recovered by the Afghan army on Monday. Eight others have been recovered by the Afghan Red Crescent Society, an affiliate of the International Red Cross. The convoy of around 80 vehicles was departing a lone army base in Gormach district that had been abandoned. They were headed to Maimana, the capital of Faryab, when their convoy was ambushed, Hashemi and Mohammad Saeedi, another provincial council member, said. Between 10 to 20 vehicles were left on the battlefield together with soldiers' bodies, both provincial council members said, adding that the vehicles were then destroyed by airstrikes on Monday night. Saeedi said that, with the base abandoned, Ghormach district is now fully controlled by the Taliban. They said government forces that were supposed to come and take over from neighbouring Badghis province never came. The Afghan Defence Ministry was unavailable for comment, in spite several efforts to reach them. Taliban militants have ramped up attacks on Afghan security forces, their facilities and the Afghan government in the past few months. Security forces are stretched thin across the war-torn country. Dozens of Afghan army soldiers were killed in fighting with Taliban militants after their base was surrounded in Faryab province earlier this month. As Taliban militants gain more territory, their ability to ambush resupply and reinforcement convoys becomes higher. Sometimes, the convoys are detained for hours, if not days, amid the violence, either because the drivers are taken hostage, or because it is unsafe to continue the journey. Experts say that the bad supply situation is also because of weak leadership and corruption within the military. Around 13.8 per cent of Afghan districts are under Taliban control while another 30 per cent are contested, according to a July report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.

We urge it to make every effort to ensure that those released do not commit new acts of violence and terror.\"The detainees have become one more issue fuelling tension in US-Afghan ties, as foreign troops, who have been in Afghanistan since 2001, steadily withdraw.The Obama administration has been pressing for months for Afghan president Hamid Karzai to sign a bilateral security agreement with Washington that would allow some American troops to stay beyond the end of this year.Reuters/AFP Topics: unrest-conflict-and-war, terrorism, world-politics, obama-barack, afghanistan, united-states Top Stories Argentina says it lacks 'modern technology' to recover submarine The little girl Australia shunned -- remembering Eve van Grafhorst Opinion: European countries have banned landfill.

Military officials earlier confirmed on Tuesday that security forces cut off a vital Taliban supply line running through the rugged Dand-e-Pathan district of Paktia near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border known as the Durand Line.The supply route, called Enzergai Kando, was used by the Taliban to transport logistics and weapons for conducting attacks in neighboring provinces, including areas near Kabul, the officials said.\"This was a very important, strategic supply line for the terrorists,\" Gen. Mohammed Radmanesh, Defense Ministry spokesman in Kabul, said.Security forces claim to have flushed out the Taliban from the area after an overnight military offensive.\"We now have a presence there and will build permanent checkposts on various parts of the route. This was a route used by the Taliban for years for transporting arms inside Afghanistan,\" said Brig. Gen. Shour Gul Pathan, commander of Afghanistan's 203 Thunder Army Corps. The Taliban used this strategic route to reach deep into the Khost, Logar and Ghazni provinces of Afghanistan and launch attacks. New border checkposts are likely to control the cross-border attacks as security forces plan to expand their presence in the area.\"The future plan of 203 Thunder Army Corps is to establish border checkpoints in areas including Khowjkaram, Enzergai Kando and Nari Kando,\" Brig. Gen. Shour Gul said.The seizure of the route came after days of operations by Afghan troops in the region, he said, adding that the militants had suffered heavy losses as a result.The Taliban could not be reached immediately for comment.The development comes after weekend clashes between Pakistani and Afghan security forces along the disputed border areas, including Dand-e-Pathan. At least three Pakistani forces and two civilians were killed in an exchange of fire that ended with both sides agreeing to a cease-fire.The Afghan government has long maintained that the Taliban enjoy safe havens and support in Pakistan but Islamabad denies the allegations.Taliban militants, overthrown in a U.S.-led invasion in late 2001, are active in many parts of Afghanistan.Earlier on Wednesday, the group claimed to have killed a key border commander of the Afghan security forces in an explosion in the southern city of Kandahar. Officials confirmed that Col. Janan Mama, along with several bodyguards, died as a result of a magnet bomb attached to his vehicle. This article has been adapted from its original source.

(AFP, file photo) Related Story: NATO hands security control to Afghan forces Map: Qatar The United States and the Taliban have agreed to hold talks that could lead to a peace deal that ends the 12-year war in Afghanistan.As it opened an office in the Qatari capital Doha, the Taliban said it wanted a political solution that would bring about a just government and end foreign occupation of Afghanistan.Just hours after the announcement of talks, four American soldiers were killed by an insurgent attack on Afghanistan's Bagram air base.White House officials said they could be in Doha to meet Taliban representatives by as early as Thursday, although president Barack Obama warned \"there will be bumps in the road\". Key pointsTalks set to take place in Doha on Thursday (local time)US wants Taliban to renounce ties with Al QaedaTaliban must commit to protecting women, minoritiesUS likely to ask for return of kidnapped soldier Bowe BergdahlTaliban expected to ask for Guantanamo prisoners to be releasedTaliban want foreign forces out of AfghanistanTaliban has not renounced Al Qaeda but will not allow attacks to be launched from Afghan soil Thursday's talks likely to involve an exchange of agendas, followed by more meetings in coming weeks Sorry, this video has expired Video: Taliban a difficult force to control, even for the Taliban (7pm TV News ACT) \"We don't anticipate this process will be easy or quick but we must pursue it in parallel with our military approach,\" he said. \"And we in the meantime remain fully committed to our military efforts to defeat Al Qaeda and to support the Afghan National Security Forces.\"Mr Obama also said he would insist on strict conditions if any deal is agreed upon.\"The one thing that we do believe, is that any insurgent group, including the Taliban, is going to need to accept an Afghan constitution that renounces ties with Al Qaeda, ends violence and is committed to protection of women and minorities in the country,\" he said.The Taliban says the Doha office will be used to as a way to reach out to the international community, with spokesman Mohammed Naeem telling a news briefing the group wants good relations with \"all of the world countries\".\"But the Islamic emirate [Taliban] sees the independence of [Afghanistan] from the current occupation as a national and religious obligation,\" he said.The US is also expected to ask for the return of US Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who has been held prisoner by the Taliban since June 2009.News of the planned talks comes as the US and its allies seek to meet a December 2014 deadline for an end to their combat operations in Afghanistan.President Karzai foreshadows talks with Taliban 'brothers'During a ceremony marking the transfer of full security responsibilities from Western troops to local forces, Afghanistan's president Hamid Karzai said his government would also be speaking to the Taliban.\"Our High Peace Council will travel to Qatar to discuss peace talks with the Taliban,\" he said. Photo: The Taliban's new office in Doha. (AFP: Faisal Al-Timimi) \"We hope that our brothers, the Taliban, also understand that the talks for the peace progress will move to their own soil in Afghanistan soon to ensure the peace in Afghanistan.\"For its part, the Taliban is expected to demand the return of prisoners being held at the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba - a move many in the US Congress oppose - as well as the departure of all foreign troops.During the talks, the Taliban will also represent the Al Qaeda-linked Haqqani network, which is considered the United States' deadliest foe in Afghanistan.The first US-Taliban meeting is expected to be an exchange of agenda, followed by another meeting a week or two later to discuss next steps.Australian Defence Minister Stephen Smith has welcomed the announcement of talks but has warned there will be no quick outcome. \"These talks will necessarily be long, complex and inevitably subject to setbacks but efforts for peace and reconciliation must continue,\" he told Parliament. He says Australia has long supported an Afghan-led peace process, in recognition that the conflict will not be ended by military force alone.A team of envoys from the Taliban flew to Qatar in early 2012 to open talks with the US government but the Taliban suspended the talks in March 2012, saying Washington was giving mixed signals on the nascent Afghan reconciliation process.Tiny, gas-rich Qatar has been an enthusiastic supporter of reconciliation efforts in a number of crises affecting the Muslim world, including those in Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Lebanon and Darfur, often hosting peace talks on its own soil to try to prove it can punch above its weight in diplomacy.ABC/Reuters Topics: unrest-conflict-and-war, world-politics, terrorism, qatar, afghanistan, united-states First posted June 19, 2013 07:10:59 Top Stories Argentina says it lacks 'modern technology' to recover submarine The little girl Australia shunned -- remembering Eve van Grafhorst Opinion: European countries have banned landfill.

In a recent ... By Peter Bergen | August 19, 2009, 5:32 PM By Peter Bergen Stephen M. Walt, fellow Foreign Policy blogger and professor of international affairs at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, and the co-author of the influential 2007 book The Israel Lobby has turned his sights on the Obama administration's strategic justification for the ramped-up American efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In a recent post for Foreign Policy Walt takes to task President Obama's assertion at an appearance before the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Monday that, \"If left unchecked, the Taliban insurgency will mean an even larger safe haven from which al Qaeda would plot to kill more Americans. So this is not only a war worth fighting. This is fundamental to the defense of our people.\" As Walt points out, \"This is a significant statement. In effect, the president was acknowledging that the only strategic rationale for an increased commitment in Afghanistan is the fear that if the Taliban isn't defeated in Afghanistan, they will eventually allow al Qaeda to re-establish itself there, which would then enable it to mount increasingly threatening attacks on the United States.\" Professor Walt has six objections to Obama's strategic rationale for the Afghan war effort that you can read in more detail, which I will summarize. First, we should not lump all jihadists in South Asia together; only some want to attack American targets. Second, that if, in the unlikely event, the Taliban came back to power in Afghanistan it's not clear that they would continue to give al Qaeda a safe haven there. Third, anyway Afghanistan is hardly an ideal place from which to launch attacks against the United States. Fourth, that if the Taliban were in power in Afghanistan the U.S. would still be able to take out any jihadist training camps based there. Fifth, an expanding American presence in Afghanistan will only feed recruitment to groups like the Taliban and al Qaeda. Finally, Walt suggests that \"one might also take comfort from the Soviet experience. When the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, the mujahidin didn't \"follow them home.\" Were the United States to withdraw from Afghanistan and the Taliban to regain power (or end up sharing power, which is more likely), going after the United States won't even be on their 'to do' list.\" All of these objections to Obama's \"Af-Pak\" strategy are seriously flawed. First, while it's true that there are many jihadist groups in South Asia with differing goals; increasingly these groups have defined themselves by their anti-Western agendas. The Taliban were a quite provincial group before 9/11 but since then they have adopted al Qaeda's world view and tactics and see themselves as part of a supposedly global jihadist movement. The late and unlamented leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, for instance, dispatched suicide bombers to Barcelona in January 2008, according to Spanish prosecutors. And nearly a year later the Kashmiri militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba launched attacks in Mumbai, specifically targeting Westerners and a Jewish-American religious center there. Taliban suicide bombers have repeatedly targeted U.S. soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan and American diplomats and commercial interests in Pakistan. Second, if the Taliban did come back to power in Afghanistan, of course they would give safe haven to al Qaeda. Despite all the pressures military and otherwise exerted on them over the past decade, giving safe haven to al Qaeda has been at the heart of the Taliban project; first in the five years before 9/11 when they ran Afghanistan, and since then in the areas of Pakistan's tribal regions that they now control. Taliban leader Mullah Omar was prepared to lose everything on the point of principle that he would not give up Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks. And he did lose everything: after 9/11, the Taliban were swiftly removed from power by U.S. forces. This does not suggest a Kissingerian talent for realpolitik. Professor Walt may be a foreign policy realist, but that doesn't make Mullah Omar one also. Third, the idea that Afghanistan is not an ideal place from which to launch anti-American attacks is simply absurd. The 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the first attack by Islamist terrorists against the United States, was led by Ramzi Yousef who trained in the Sadda training camp on the Afghan-Pakistan border. The bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998 that killed more than 200 were coordinated and carried out by men who had trained in Afghanistan, as was the attack on the USS Cole two years later. And while, as Walt points out, elements of the 9/11 plot were coordinated in Hamburg -- where three of the pilots had lived in the run-up to the attacks -- the idea of attacking iconic targets in Washington and New York was first hatched in Afghanistan in 1996; the coordination of the attacks took place in Afghanistan over the next several years; the pilots were given their specific orders about target selection and their duties by the leaders of al Qaeda when they travelled to Afghanistan in 1999, and all 15 of the 'muscle' hijackers passed through al Qaeda's Afghan training camps. And after the fall of the Taliban when al Qaeda was forced out of Afghanistan into the neighboring tribal regions of Pakistan -- where they were then given shelter by the Pakistani Taliban -- al Qaeda coordinated from there the largest terrorist attack in British history -- the four suicide bombings on London's transportation system on July 7, 2005 that killed 52 commuters. Fourth: yes, if the Taliban did take over Afghanistan the United States would still be able to attack jihadist training camps there, but is Professor Walt suggesting that somehow a Taliban takeover really helps American interests simply because the U.S. could then rely on drone attacks and other measures to take out jihadist training camps there? Fifth, Walt invokes a version of the hoary 'antibody' argument that the more American troops there are in Afghanistan the more they will be treated like a foreign bacillus and so help the Taliban to recruit and the like. Since 2005 BBC/ABC News have conducted yearly polls around the country that test this proposition and have found it wanting. Four years after the fall of the Taliban, eight out of ten Afghans expressed in the BBC/ABC poll a favorable opinion of the United States, and the same number supported foreign soldiers in their country. Today 63 % of Afghans continue to approve of the international forces in their country. And around half have a favorable view the U.S.; in the Muslim world only the Lebanese have a more rosy view of America. Walt saves one of his flimsiest arguments for last arguing that because the mujahideen did not attack Russia after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 that once the Taliban are in power that attacking America won't be on their \"to do list.\" But as we have seen, when the Taliban were in control of Afghanistan their al Qaeda allies launched a multitude of attacks on American targets. And, similarly, after 9/11 when the Taliban was hosting al Qaeda in Pakistan's tribal areas the group planned the 2006 'planes' operation; a scheme to bring down seven American and Canadian airliners with liquid explosives after they had departed from Heathrow. Luckily the plot was discovered but if it had gone through the attacks would have killed as many as 1,500 civilians. The implication of Walt's objection to the ramped-up Obama strategy in Afghanistan is that the U.S. should either do less in Afghanistan, or even just get out altogether. But America has already gone down this road. Twice. In 1989 the U.S. closed its embassy in Kabul and then effectively zeroed out aid to one of the poorest countries in the world; meanwhile Afghanistan was racked by a civil war, which spawned the Taliban who then gave safe haven to al Qaeda. Then in the winter of 2001 the Bush administration overthrew the Taliban, and because of its aversion to nation-building rebuilt the country on the cheap and quickly got distracted by the war in Iraq. Into the resulting vacuum stepped a resurgent Taliban. This time the movement of religious warriors was much more closely aligned with al Qaeda. So the U.S. has already tried the Do Nothing approach and the Do It Light approach in Afghanistan, the results of which are well known. The Obama administration is now attempting a Do It Seriously approach, which has a real chance of success. For an expanded version of some of these arguments here is a piece I did for the Washington Monthly last month. Peter Bergen is a senior fellow at the New America Foundation and the author of The Osama bin Laden I Know.

According to the message released by Taliban, it is also said that Taliban fighters should avoid participation in civilian's gatherings in eid days to prevent civil casualties during air attacks of Afghan forces.

The video was posted late on Wednesday by Jama'a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM), which has been linked to the kidnapping of at least six Western hostages in recent years, SITE said in an email to clients that included a link to the video. It shows a frail Sophie Petronin, a French aid worker who was kidnapped in Mali's restive northeast in late 2016, being cared for in a tent-like structure by fellow captive Gloria Narvaez, who was abducted in early 2017 in southern Mali near the border with Burkina Faso. Both women address the camera directly, one after the other. Petronin says the date is June 7. She speaks through tears to her son and tells him she is \"very, very exhausted.\" Narvaez addresses Pope Francis, asking him to intervene for Petronin, who she says is \"truly sick\". French civilians have long been favoured targets for kidnapping by criminal and Islamist groups in the arid West African region, partly owing to perceptions that the French government is prepared to pay ransoms to secure their release. In 2013, French troops drove back al Qaeda-linked groups that had seized cities and towns in northern Mali a year earlier. Islamist militants have repeatedly declared since then that French citizens in West Africa are targets.

But they're finding common cause against the threat of Islamic State followers in Afghanistan. LONDON -- A bloody clash between the Afghan Taliban and followers of the so-called Islamic State late last month in western Afghanistan has exposed critical shifts in alliances in a war the United States is still trying to fight. Most important, there appear to be consultations, at least, between the Taliban and Iran about how to meet the growing threat posed by the extremists of ISIS, as the self-proclaimed Islamic State is widely known. An Afghan Taliban commander and former provincial governor in the days when one-eyed Mullah Omar ruled Afghanistan tells The Daily Beast that the battle on May 24 in the Khaki Safe area of Farah province near the Iranian border left at least 22 people dead, including 13 associated with ISIS and nine Taliban. \"This was the biggest fight between the Afghan Taliban and ISIS followers so far,\" said the former governor, who is still deeply involved with Taliban military operations and asked that his name not be used.

In the last few months Pakistan's Government has made a number of decisions that have drawn the country even further into China's Geo-Strategic orbit. And although China and Pakistan have had a long and fruitful relationship for well over 50 years, it was the launch of the 2,900 km China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) during a visit to Pakistan by Chinese President Xi Jinping in April that qualitatively changed the relationship. This $46 billion CPEC project, which involves the construction of roads, railroads and power plants over a 15-year period, comes on top of other previous important Pakistan-China agreements in the military, energy and infrastructure fields. The geostrategic importance of CPEC is bolstered by some earlier bilateral agreements. First, in April China was granted 40-year operation rights to the port of Gwadar on the Indian Ocean, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. Beijing is expected to invest $1.62 billion in Gwadar. Gwadar will be where the CPEC begins and eventually makes its way to Kashgar in western China. Eventually when the port is fully operational and CPEC is completed, China will be able to transship some of its oil needs from that port, thus saving billions and precious time and most importantly avoiding the potentially vulnerable Malacca Strait. Gwadar will play a critical part in China's land and maritime silk routes, linking it to Central Asia and beyond.

And it's not ISIS. A few months after Mosul fell in Iraq last summer and the Islamic State group (also known as ISIS) rose to prominence, we began hearing murmurs that ISIS had spread eastward, into Afghanistan. The extent of ISIS' activities and presence in Afghanistan remain ambiguous, but the Taliban have started to feel the group's impact. This week, the Taliban warned Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State and its self-styled caliph, that \"jihad against the Americans and their allies [in Afghanistan] must be conducted under one flag and one leadership.\" The Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan largely remain loyal to Mullah Omar, the group's reclusive leader who holds the title of Amir al-Mu'minin (Commander of the Faithful).

This is dangerously untrue and feeds into a policy-process that has failed to come to terms with the most serious problem in South Asia: Pakistan.

Qatar has reportedly secured the release of four Tajik border guards kidnapped by the Afghan Taliban in December. The four men-reported by Asia-Plus in January to be Farhod Kalonov, Mehroj Shodiyev, Siroj Davlatov and Tuychibek Nourboyev-were members of border unit 2610 stationed along the Panj river which forms a majority of the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The Panj river is wide, meandering, and quite shallow at some points. According to a source in the Border Service, quoted by Eurasianet, the Tajik guards were captured on the Afghan side of the river in Kunduz province, which has seen increased militant activity this year.

Khalid refused to name the country. Nor did he specify the number of planes to be sold, although he stated that deliveries will begin in 2017. He did, however, emphasize that 11 other countries have shown interest in acquiring the multirole fighter aircraft. Numerous air forces are toying with the idea of purchasing the JF-17, and the media has floated more than a dozen potential export destinations, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Bulgaria (see: \"Pakistan and China May Finally Have a JF-17 Buyer\"), Myanmar, Nigeria, the Philippines, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.

By Kunal Singh June 15, 2015 Source Link For 15 years, since its inception in February 2000, General Khalid Kidwai served as Director General of Pakistan's Strategic Plans Division. Now an adviser to Pakistan's National Command Authority, Kidwai was a speaker at the recent biennial Carnegie Nuclear Policy Conference. Offering a glimpse into Pakistan's strategic thinking, he explained Pakistan's shift from a strategy of \"minimum credible deterrence\" to \"full spectrum deterrence.\" During his talk, Kidwai justified Pakistan's induction of battlefield nuclear weapons with operational ranges as low as 60 kilometers on the pretext of anon-existent \"Cold Start\" doctrine. Kidwai's remarks have re-opened the debate over South Asia's nuclear stability. A Stimson Center essay by Jeffrey McCausland has expanded on the dangers of Pakistan incorporating tactical nuclear weapons (TNWs).

After a decade of bloodshed that killed more than 50,000 civilians and soldiers, Pakistan's military finally became fed up last June when a homegrown militant group, the Pakistan Taliban, attacked Karachi's international airport. In response, Pakistan's air force and army began pounding North Waziristan, destroying two cities there while also ordering the evacuation of more than a million residents. Since then, the number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan has plunged as the Pakistan Taliban and al Qaeda appear to have fewer havens.

But they've been recreated with the help of lasers. Residents of Bamiyan got a rare opportunity over the weekend: a chance to once again see giant Buddhas that have been piles of rubble for over a decade. 3-D projection technology has already been used to resurrect dead music legends and pipe busy politicians into campaign rallies, and now it's been employed to recreate a cultural icon that watched over this valley in Afghanistan for more than 1,500 years.

At least 15 to 20 militants, wearing Security Forces' (SF) uniforms, came in three pickup trucks and abducted some 35 passengers. The militants subsequently killed 22, and set free another five. The fate of the remaining eight is unknown. Lamenting the Mastung carnage, Qaumi Watan Party (QWP) Chairperson Aftab Ahmad Sherpao expressed his anxiety over ethnic violence and observed that the miscreants wanted to create ethnic chaos in the Province, as they killed 22 Pashtuns, and let the non-Pashtun cleaners off the buses after checking their identity cards. The United Baloch Army (UBA), a Baloch separatist group, claimed responsibility for the killings. Mureed Baloch, UBA 'spokesman', declared on May 30, \"It is a revenge for killing of militants in Mastung and Kalat areas by Security Forces.\" Read more >> Posted by Maj Gen P K Mallick, VSM(Retd) at 00:35 No comments: Links to this post 15 June 2015 Book Review: 88 Days to Kandahar Jonathan Steele June 13, 2015 It is easy to forget that until he started criticising the Americans for bombing too many Afghan civilians and comparing them to \"occupiers\", Hamid Karzai was Washington's grateful servant. After all, US officials picked him to be Afghanistan's first post-Taliban president, armed and financed him to launch an uprising against the mullahs after 9/11, helicoptered him away from imminent capture after one clumsy foray inside Afghanistan in mid-October, reinserted him a few weeks later to march on Kandahar successfully, and finally foisted him on the rest of the Afghan political class at the United Nations-sponsored conference in Bonn in December 2001 as the leader they could not afford to reject. Robert Grenier's fascinating book shows just how close the Karzai-US relationship was at that stage. As the Central Intelligence Agency's station chief in Islamabad, Grenier played a key part in what he calls (in a nod to the three Anglo-Afghan wars) the first American-Afghan war. It lasted 88 days, from 9/11 until the capture of the Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar's compound in Kandahar. Much of Grenier's time was spent trying to persuade tribal chieftains, often with cash, to rise up against the Taliban, or even - in the other hallowed CIA tradition - plotting with a senior Taliban commander to mount a palace coup against Omar. No other US official has yet chronicled this period so intimately, including detailed records of meetings and phone calls.

The assault came as Afghanistan's military acknowledged the Taliban controls at least four districts across the country. The attacks in Helmand hit police checkpoints in the Musa Qala district, long a Taliban stronghold, said Mohammad Ismail Hotak, the head of the province's joint coordination of police and military operations. He said the attacks wounded at least 10 officers, though the Taliban also seemed to have suffered high casualties. Saqi Jan, the head of police logistics in Musa Qala, said area checkpoints were manned by officers from the neighboring district of Baghran who had been forced out by earlier Taliban attacks.

And although China and Pakistan have had a long and fruitful relationship for well over 50 years, it was the launch of the 2,900 km China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) during a visit to Pakistan by Chinese President Xi Jinping in April that qualitatively changed the relationship. This $46 billion CPEC project, which involves the construction of roads, railroads and power plants over a 15-year period, comes on top of other previous important Pakistan-China agreements in the military, energy and infrastructure fields.

Paul Ross, IMF Mission Chief in Afghanistan, said at the Atlantic Council that his counterparts are \"optimistic about the long term, but they do see some short-term challenges\" in Afghanistan. In recent discussions with Afghan officials, he said \"there was a very strong impetus and desire of the [Ghani] administration to agree [to] something with the IMF as a way of signaling to the world that Afghanistan is open for business and the new administration is determined to proceed with reforms.\" Read more >> Posted by Maj Gen P K Mallick, VSM(Retd) at 00:35 No comments: Links to this post 13 June 2015 This is what happens when you send Islamist proxy warriors to fight your battles By Nisid Hajari Source Link Smoke rises above the Jinnah International Airport, where security forces battled militants June 9, 2014, in Karachi, Pakistan. (AP Photo/Shakil Adil) (AP) Nisid Hajari is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board and the author of \"Midnight's Furies: The Deadly Legacy of India's Partition.\" At the outset of World War II, far from the battlefields of Europe, British colonial officials in India bought themselves a jihad. They secretly spread cash all along the turbulent Afghan frontier, encouraging mullahs in the Islamic tribal region to whip up sentiment against Britain's enemies: first the godless Soviets and their then-allies the Nazis, later the brutal Japanese and eventually Indian leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, who were refusing to back the war effort. The strategy was low-cost and surprisingly effective. \"In some areas,\" marveled Sir George Cunningham, governor of the North-West Frontier Province, \"religious Talibs [students] were encouraged to go into the Army -- a thing which . . . was unknown before.\" Read more >> Posted by Maj Gen P K Mallick, VSM(Retd) at 00:35 No comments: Links to this post 12 June 2015 WHY DOES PAKISTAN ACCUSE INDIAN SPIES OF TERRORISM? Michael Kugelman June 9, 2015 Source Link Several weeks ago, the Pakistani armed forces accused India's intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, or RAW, of fomenting terrorism. A statement issued by the military's media wing after a Corps Commanders conference on May 5 minced no words. \"The Conference...took serious notice of RAW's involvement in whipping up terrorism in Pakistan.\" RAW Emotion Accusing Indian spies of subversive and nefarious activities in Pakistan is an age-old practice. Such charges afford Pakistani officials a means of shielding themselves from blame for their country's ills. They also convey a reassuring Muslims-cannot-be-responsible-for violence message that plays well among the general population. Yet, these accusations go well beyond terrorism. Pakistanis have constantly conjured up conspiracies that deposit blame for all manner of misfortune -- from floods to fraud scandals -- on India's doorstep.

Many were surprised that Saad Aziz, one of the arrested militants, came from a privileged and educated background. With Aziz having confessed to his involvement in both attacks, the question remains: What led him down this path? Aziz's privileged background as a graduate of Pakistan's top business school should not have been a surprise. Many prominent terrorists in recent history have been born to Pakistani parents and well-educated, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, who graduated from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical University, and Omar Saeed Sheikh, the man responsible for the brutal murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, was a master chess player and graduate of the London School of Economics.

Over 300 civilians a month are dying, mostly because of Taliban and drug gang efforts to terrorize civilians into supporting, or at least not opposing them. Casualties are up for the security forces as well but Taliban and drug gang losses are up the most (over 80 percent compared to last year). For example in May over 4,600 \"hostile individuals\" were killed. The drug gangs and their Islamic terrorist allies (mainly the Taliban and Haqqani Network) are desperate to resist increased effort by Afghanistan and Pakistan to destroy the power of the drug lords. Meanwhile the Taliban have a growing problem with former Taliban (including most of the non-Afghans, mainly from Central Asia and Chechnya) who have left to form local branches of ISIL (Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant). It was recently revealed that on June 3rd a group of Taliban in the east (Nangarhar province) were ambushed by ISIL members and ten of the Taliban were eventually found with their heads cut off. The Taliban tried to keep this a secret but the news got out and spread. ISIL has declared war on the Taliban and justified it with accusations that the Taliban were created and still work for Pakistan. This is largely true, but the Taliban also work for local drug gangs.

BNA reporter regarding the issue writes ISIS and Taliban in Afghanistan had a hostile and hateful view against each other. Taliban considered ISIS as a project has established as an alternative for them. The Caliphate of ISIS considered the Islamic Emirate of Taliban composed of Sunny illiterate clergies, while Taliban considered ISIS as looter of values that mujahidin (Taliban) achieved. ISIS since its establishment not more three years ago, have always been at the focus of attentions and had been the target of Taliban, Afghan and foreign forces alike. For this reason, ISIS did not succeed to get ground in Afghanistan as the intelligence services of the region planned. The recent blows that ISIS sustained in Afghanistan lead to the complete eradication of the group in Koot and Achen districts of Nangarhar province. At the same time, Hafeez Sayeed a Pakistani citizen the leader of ISIS in Afghanistan and the most notorious terrorist in international level killed. Therefore, if situation continues in this way, the name of ISIS will be eliminating from military arena in Afghanistan forever. Political experts believe the fragile situation of ISIS in Afghanistan has caused by their sponsor this is the intelligence service of Pakistan is comprehensible, in one hand they don't want ISIS get power in the region, on the other hand not want ISIS to be remove from the current political games in Afghanistan. The political experts say the creator of ISIS and Taliban projects in Afghanistan is the same satanic source that enjoys huge influence among the groups tries to remove the hostilities between the groups in order to support them in war against Afghan security forces. On the other hand the hostilities between Taliban and ISIS both intelligence projects, not lead to the complete eradication of ISIS from the military scene in Afghanistan. According to Afghan politicians while Taliban and ISIS interring in alliance and since two months there were no any conflict between them, but it would be impossible for them to forget their earlier hostilities that had led to heavy casualties to both sides. Therefore, one cannot expect the alliance between Taliban and ISIS to continue for a long time, but can provide an opportunity for ISIS for recruiting and organizing itself once again. The general commander of international forces in Afghanistan has said that the coalition between ISIS and Taliban was a fragile alliance and could not call it a breakthrough and effective agreement. The spokesperson of national defense ministry also has said that the alliance between Taliban and ISIS in not a concerning issue for them. According to him, they are both the enemies of Afghanistan and a part of foreign intelligence services' programs fighting against Afghans. The Afghan security forces are determined to suppress them as the enemies of Afghanistan and Afghan people.
