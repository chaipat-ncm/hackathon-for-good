Associated Press Editorials NATO summit: Trump trashes our allies, and Republicans offer a peep of protest By the Observer editorial board LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story July 11, 2018 10:35 AM The U.S. Senate passed an important foreign policy measure this week, except for the fact that you probably didn't hear about it. The motion, passed late Tuesday, expressed the Senate's support for NATO and called on U.S. negotiators to reaffirm our country's commitment to it. It came as Donald Trump was leaving for Brussels to meet with world leaders at the NATO summit. Trump has been trashing NATO in tweets -- much the same as he's savaged many of our allies. Senators are clearly worried about this president's middle-schooler approach to world issues. How worried? The motion passed 97-2. Yet afterward, senators were quiet about what they'd just done. They didn't hold news conferences urging the president to be presidential in Brussels. They didn't find their way onto news shows to warn Trump of the consequences of threatening relationships with key allies.

SUBSCRIBE NOW Instead, the 97-2 Senate vote was little more than a peep -- a parent meekly pleading with the troublemaking teenager to make good choices as he strutted out the door. Already, Trump is not making good choices. On the summit's first day, he has launched a blistering attack on Germany -- a favorite target -- for buying natural gas from Russia. He unloaded on NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg for not spending enough on defense. The latter is one of Trump's favorite complaints -- that our allies are not spending 2 percent of their gross domestic products on defense, as NATO leaders have agreed to do. U.S. presidents have long been critical of allies not pulling their weight on defense spending, but Trump is taking those complaints to new -- and inaccurate -- levels. He suggests wrongly that countries falling short on defense spending and funding NATO's budget need to reimburse the U.S., which is not how NATO funding works. He also neglects to mention that NATO countries have improved on defense spending -- and that they have until 2024 to reach their 2 percent goal. All of which has prompted worries that Trump might pull the U.S. out of NATO, which would serve virtually no one's interests. One country, however, would be very pleased: Russia, which would benefit from fractured alliances between NATO countries. U.S. lawmakers know this, which is why they not only have pleaded with Trump on NATO, but fretted about steep tariffs he has levied on key allies and China. But Republicans in Congress need to do more than offer a meek protest for political cover. They need to speak up loudly about the benefits of NATO, including the advancement of democratic governance worldwide along with a stronger international economy. They need to remind Trump and Americans of NATO's original and still important purpose -- presenting a united front that deters aggression from adversaries, including Moscow, on our allies. More importantly, Republicans need to publicly question why Trump doesn't value that purpose, and why he so readily trashes other countries but not the one nation that meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It's become a familiar choice for lawmakers with this president. Will they risk political peril and speak up for our nation's interests? Will they choose our country over their next race? We hope so. Donald Trump is upending the international order. A peep is not enough.

The reality is probably more prosaic. Europe is finally realizing that before saving the world, it needs to save itself from the assault of its former protector, the United States.The European side of the trans-Atlantic family is at last accepting the idea that its reliable uncle has turned into a bully. Sure, that kinsman was always bossy, easily irritated. But when the going got rough, Europeans knew they could count on him. After all, they came from the same world, with common memories and values, and shared interests.Since Mr. Trump's July sweep through Europe -- to Brussels, England, Scotland and Helsinki -- that certainty has evaporated. The American president made clear that he could not care less about common memories and values, that he hates the family's culture, its do-gooder attitude. He sees America's interests differently. He has convinced himself that the family is taking advantage of him. \"You're stealing from my piggy bank!\" he rages. He wants his money back. \"Me first!\" has become his motto.Mr. Trump, who has never liked strong women, brutally pressured Angela Merkel of Germany and Britain's Theresa May. The last thing he wants is a united family, so he plays on Europe's divisions, openly courting rebellious members of the bloc who promote his toxic views.The family is somehow holding together, but is traumatized. It is not ready to cut ties with the uncle. Yet it knows, now, that it must devise a new way to deal with this angry, out-of-control, but still powerful big man -- and possibly learn to live without him.All this theater was on display in Brussels on July 11 and 12 when the 29 NATO members convened. After a blast at Germany before breakfast, things went relatively smoothly on the first day. Over dinner, Mr. Trump entertained his counterparts by bragging about his meeting with Kim Jong-un of North Korea.The next morning, all hell broke loose. The president turned up late at a meeting about NATO's partnership with Georgia and Ukraine. According to a senior European diplomat who wished to remain anonymous, Mr. Trump took the floor and \"engaged into a 20-minute rant on just about everything -- the disastrous new NATO H.Q., unfair burden sharing, immigration, the trade imbalance, the BMWs on American roads.\"\"He said about 23 times that we were not paying enough,\" the diplomat said. \"He was completely out of control, pounding on us, while his advisers kept their eyes fixed on their shoes. We had expected some trouble, but this was really brutal. We were shellshocked.\"The Georgian and Ukrainian delegations were asked to leave, looking, said a NATO official who also wished to remain anonymous, \"as embarrassed as neighbors invited to a family reunion that turns sour.\" Behind closed doors, Germany took another beating. Mr. Trump now demanded not 2 but 4 percent of each country's G.D.P. as a defense spending goal, a totally unrealistic figure that nobody took seriously.The Europeans started to react. The first to speak out was Lithuania's president, Dalia Grybauskaite, another strong woman, who happens to be a black belt in karate. She defended Ms. Merkel, whose leadership, she pointed out, was crucial to achieving European unity on sanctions against Russia. The Slovak prime minister also came to the rescue. But by then, Mr. Trump was satisfied with his tantrum. He could go out and tell the media that thanks to him, the free-riders had agreed to pay up -- even though those commitments predated his presidency.Mrs. Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron of France chose to stay calm and focus on the positive: The alliance had survived, it had issued a strong statement on Russia and it had laid the groundwork for important future military developments.This turned out to be cold comfort. Two more episodes of Mr. Trump's diplomatic killing game -- his very public humiliation of Mrs. May in England and his embarrassing servility before President Vladimir Putin of Russia in Helsinki -- would only add insult to injury. At each stage of this ordeal, European officials were struck by how little influence the president's men seemed to have on him -- men like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the national security adviser, John Bolton.How, then, can Europe work with Donald Trump? The senior European diplomat lists two problems: \"One is the impact he has on the real world -- he breaks everything. The other problem is that we're facing a sinking administration.\" He likened it to a \"a ship without deckhands, whose captain has lost his mind.\"Mr. Macron's strategy is to stay the multilateral course, with or without the United States, while strengthening \"European strategic thinking.\" Mr. Pompeo had all but invited that when he told The Wall Street Journal last month that \"a reset\" was needed because global alliances were no longer paying dividends for the United States.This shift comes amid a growing awareness in European business and political circles that Europe is not included in the big power struggle -- among America, China and Russia -- that defines the Trumpian world. The economic theorist Jacques Attali warns that \"for the U.S., Europe is no longer a partner; it has become prey.\" France's ambassador to the United Nations, Francois Delattre, says that Europe \"must assert itself as one of the true poles of action and influence of a new multipolar world.\"This implies two conditions: Europe must overcome its divisions, so adroitly exploited by Messrs. Trump and Putin, and Germany needs to come to terms with the concept of European power.France, a military and nuclear power, has a long history of managing political and strategic differences with America, and would enroll even a post-Brexit Britain in this endeavor. But for Germany, this is an existential crisis. For almost 80 years, it has flourished under the protective umbrella of the United States to become the biggest and most prosperous country in the European Union. Now it sees all the pillars of its foreign policy collapsing, East and West, and is slowly taking stock of the wider assault on Europe.There is already one domain where Europe is showing that it can think and act strategically: trade. On July 17, the day after Mr. Trump declared the European Union \"a foe\" while publicly complimenting his \"good competitor\" Vladimir Putin, European leaders joined Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in Tokyo to sign a major trade deal, creating the largest bilateral free trade area ever and proclaiming, \"We stand together against protectionism.\" While in Asia, they also held a summit meeting with China's president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing.Take that, Uncle.Sylvie Kauffmann is the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde, and a contributing opinion writer.

Associated Press Donald Trump at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday. Associated Press Op-Ed Wake up, NATO. Trump doesn't believe in allies. By Ivan Krastev The New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story July 12, 2018 10:26 AM Not so long ago, Europeans believed that despite Donald Trump's harsh words, Washington would never endanger its Cold War alliances. \"Do not read his tweets, follow his actions,\" senior American officials told their European colleagues when the conversation turned to the future of the trans-Atlantic relations. How wrong we were to believe them. It was the tweets that really mattered in the end.Within hours of the religiously anticipated NATO summit in Brussels, President Trump was castigating Germany, historically one of America's closest allies, claiming, ridiculously, that it is \"captive\" to Russia and calling NATO countries \"delinquent.\"Clearly, Trump is ignoring European Council President Donald Tusk's appeal: \"Dear America, appreciate your allies. After all, you don't have that many.\"For Trump, America's alliances symbolize everything that is misguided about his country's foreign policy. In a 1990 interview with Playboy magazine, he said that the United States is \"defending wealthy nations for nothing -- nations that would be wiped off the earth in about 15 minutes if it weren't for us.\" They \"laugh at our stupidity.\" His views don't seem to have changed since then.Europeans are now finally being forced to realize that Trump's world is one shorn of allies.Here's why the European leaders are so surprised: It's not difficult to imagine a mainstream political leader campaigning with promises to build a wall on the border, move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and punish the Chinese government for its economic policies. Mainstream politicians might easily pledge all of these, but upon assuming power they would never act on them.Like today's other populist leaders, Trump knows that his standing with voters hinges on making good on his most radical promises. All the populist leader has to do is be different from the mainstream -- to do what mainstream politicians would never do.What makes Europeans particularly vulnerable in the Trump era is that they still view themselves as America's allies. But in Trump's world, there no longer is any concept of alliances. It is not that he is displeased with European military spending or with Europe's position on Iran. Rather, it is that in a world where America is a disruptor and not a force for stability, allies are now a burden. They have expectations and claims that constrain America's policies, whether that is a preferential trade agreement or a commitment to joint military exercises. Worse, they insist on predictability and reciprocity, which are completely out of sync with Trump's view of the world.Peering through Trump's twisted prism, one finds not friends and enemies, but fans and enemies. Fans are those who are loyal to you no matter what; they never expect reciprocity. Enemies are also valuable because they help you solve problems; you can assert your power by breaking them or befriending them. The Trump administration's approach to the North Korean enemy is a perfect example of this. Its relationship with Russia -- Trump is meeting with Vladimir Putin next week -- could be the next example.Europeans are doomed if they think the issue now is how to salvage their alliance with the United States. The time for that has passed. The challenge now for the leaders of Europe is learn to live in a world where America has no allies.For a start, they can show that they take seriously the need to provide for their own security, investing in autonomous European defense capacity rather than relying so much on the United States. The Europeans must also discover that while their unity is important, it can help to be a little unpredictable themselves. They also can give up their posture of learned helplessness when it comes to Russia.The logic of the post-Cold War world has been that the United States exercises its global influence by preserving and expanding its alliances. This logic no longer holds. The gravest risk the European Union faces is to be the guardian of a status quo that has ceased to exist.Ivan Krastev is a NYT contributing opinion writer, the chairman of the Center for Liberal Strategies, a permanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna and the author, most recently, of \"After Europe.\" Premium content for only $0.99 For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today.

Trump had already harshly criticized North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations that have failed to hit a target of spending 2 percent of their gross domestic products on defense. On Wednesday, he upped the ante. \"During the president's remarks today at the NATO summit he suggested that countries not only meet their commitment of 2% of their GDP on defense spending, but that they increase it to 4%,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. \"President Trump wants to see our allies share more of the burden and at a very minimum meet their already stated obligations.\" But it was his scorn for Germany, expressed hours before the summit's official opening and amid domestic political turmoil for Chancellor Angela Merkel, that first grabbed the attention of America's closest allies. Trump said it is not fair to American taxpayers that Germany buys oil and gas from Russia while enjoying the umbrella of defense provided by U.S. dollars. \"Germany is a captive of Russia,\" he said, pointing out that the country pays \"billions and billions of dollars\" to Russia for energy. Trump highlighted that \"Germany is a rich country\" and asked why the U.S. should \"protect you against Russia\" when the two countries are making deals. \"You tell me, is that appropriate?\" he asked, adding that \"Germany is totally controlled by Russia.\" In brief remarks to reporters outside the NATO conference, Merkel asserted that Germany is independent from Russia and contributes to the mutual defense of its member nations, and added that she was prepared to have \"controversial\" discussions. Merkel, who was raised behind the Soviet Union's Iron Curtain in East Germany, also noted pointedly that unified Germany is now free from the yoke of Moscow. Trump's harsh words for the longtime U.S. ally are part of a larger broadside against European nations that the president says are taking advantage of America. His criticism of Germany signaled that he has no intention of easing pressure on alliance nations just because Europe is nervous that tensions could empower Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom Trump isA scheduled to meet Monday in Helsinki. German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said later Wednesday that she didn't \"really understand what he means\" by saying her nation is \"captive\" to Russia. \"We have a lot of issues with Russia, without any doubt, but on the other hand you should keep a communication line between countries or alliances and opponents without any question,\" she said. \"So I'm curious to listen in-depth in the meeting what the American president is meaning by that.\" Merkel and Trump, who arrived at the NATO summit via a different entrance than the other world leaders, met privately about 9:15 a.m. ET. The two leaders discussed the pipeline, Trump said when they broke to chat with reporters. He did not elaborate. The meeting was \"great\" and he has a \"very, very good relationship\" with Merkel, Trump said. Speaking in German, Merkel said they discussed trade and migration. Later, Trump held a similar sitdown with French President Emmanuel Macron. After their meeting, Macron was asked if he agreed that Merkel is beholden to Russia. Trump jokingly interjected that he was glad the question had been posed to the French president. Macron deflected, saying he and Trump discussed NATO cooperation. Trump didn't give NATO allies much time to get settled. His fusillade was delivered even before the pomp-filled welcoming ceremony opened the NATO summit, as he and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg spoke to reporters before having breakfast together. While Stoltenberg said a \"strong NATO is good for Europe and good for the United States,\" he tried to temper Trump's criticism of partner nations. aWe have all been able to unite around our core values, that we are all stronger together than apart,a he said. Trump pushed back. aHow can you be stronger when a country is getting energy from the person you want to protect against?a the president asked. aBecause we understand when we stand together we are stronger,a Stoltenberg explained. Trump replied, \"No, you are just making Russia richer.\" The president's comments appeared to be a reference to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas from Russia to Germany's northeastern Baltic coast, bypassing Eastern European nations like Poland and Ukraine and doubling the amount of gas Russia can send directly to Germany. The vast undersea pipeline is opposed by the U.S. and some other E.U. members, who warn it could give Moscow greater leverage over Western Europe. Earlier, Trump said that he had \"great confidence\" in Stoltenberg, and gave him credit for working to deal with the \"unfair burden\" he said was being footed by the U.S. The line of argument is nothing new for Trump: It's been his most consistent criticism of traditional American allies and one that he made both atA a campaign rally in Montana last weekA and in Washington just before he departed forA his trip to Europe. But the message landed differently a a little more directly a now that he is in Brussels and meeting face-to-face with the leaders of NATO nations. Trump has turned decades of American diplomacy on its head, former U.S. ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns said Wednesday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \"It's just infuriating to watch this happen,\" Burns said. \"You cannot imagine any American president all the way back 75 years deciding to become the critic-in-chief of NATO. I mean, it's Orwellian. He's making our friends out to be our enemies and heas treating our enemies, like Putin, as our friends.\" In a joint statement issued Wednesday, the top two Democrats in Congress, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, said Trump's behavior at NATO sent a \"profoundly disturbing signal\" that he is \"more loyal to President Putin\" than the alliance. \"If the president leaves the Putin meeting without ironclad assurances and concrete steps toward a full cessation of Russian attacks on our democracy, this meeting will not only be a failure a it will be a grave step backward for the future of the international order and global security,\" they said. While Trump didn't mention Merkel by name in his remarks early Wednesday, they clashedA at last month's G-7 summit, and he laterA took a swipe at her on TwitterA a wrongly stating that crime was rising in her country because of mass migration. He also referred to Merkel at the Montana event, saying, \"I donat know how much protection we get by protecting you.\" The president's ambassador to NATO, former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, said last week that the goal of the summit is to project unity. But Trump's demands, and his criticism of Germany, threaten that outcome. Laura Rosenberger, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund and a foreign policy adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, told NBC News that Trump is only helping Russia by exposing and creating fissures within NATO. \"While concerns about Nord Stream 2 are real, accusing Germany of being captive to Russia is patently false a and frankly feels like a bit of projection coming from Trump,\" Rosenberger said. \"But more broadly, the fact that he chose to start off the summitas events by attacking one of our allies, instead of stressing our unity ... is itself a win for Putin.\" At the end of the day, the NATO heads of state released a 79-point joint declaration that mentioned Russia 56 times, and Stoltenberg said a Wednesday night dinner would focus on Russia. But he demurred when asked about Trump's request that countries reach a new target of spending 4 percent of the size of their individual economies on defense. \"Well, I will focus on what we have agreed, and we have agreed to be committed to the pledge increasing defense spending to 2 percent, and letas start with that,\" he said. \"So we have a way to go, but the good news is weave really started to deliver.\" Most Popular Stories Sports CIF cif southern section football Video Xavier Prep's Historic CIF-SS Run Ends In 57-13 Semifinal Loss November 16, 2018 Local Butte County California Fires Camp Fire Paradise Wildfires EXCLUSIVE: Camp Fire Survivor Already at Home in the Valley November 16, 2018 Local Video Mother Claims Unfair Punishment After La Quinta Basketball Brawl November 16, 2018 #trending California Congress Democrats House Mimi Walters Orange County President Trump Republican Senate Trump Administration United States White House Democrats pick up another House seat in California with Walters concession November 16, 2018 #trending Health Drug Company Drug Prices Drugs Health Pfizer President Trump Trump Administration Pfizer to raise drug prices despite Trump complaints November 16, 2018 View More Related Articles Local EXCLUSIVE: Camp Fire Survivor Already at Home in the Valley Local Mother Claims Unfair Punishment After La Quinta Basketball Brawl CommunityLocal Community impact of the Augustine Band of Cahuilla Indians Connect With Us Close Do Not Miss Anything#NBCPalmSpringsReceive a weekly email with the most relevant and viral of what you have to know.

His recent criticism had raised concerns and doubts over the commitment of NATO troops. The US President had repeatedly called on the Europeans, Germany in particular, to increase their military spending in order to meet their commitment to raise them to 2% of their GDP. \"I told them I would be very unhappy if they did not substantially increase their commitments because the US is paying a huge amount,\" Trump told a news conference. However, \"it is not necessary\" to threaten to leave the institution to convince them, he said. The US president has instead preferred to salute the \"immense progress\" obtained, according to him, in their financial commitments. \"Yesterday, I let them know that I was extremely dissatisfied with what was happening and they have significantly increased their commitments,\" he said. \"When we reach 2%, we can start talking about going further,\" he said, citing the figure of 4%, which he had already suggested to the Allies on Wednesday. \"I think 4% is the right number.\" \"Now we are very happy to have a very powerful NATO, very strong, much stronger than two days ago,\" said the US president. An opinion shared by the French President, Emmanuel Macron, according to which NATO emerged \"much stronger\" from this summit, especially because Donald Trump has \"reaffirmed its commitment (...) to have a strong NATO\". On Wednesday, on the first day of the summit, Mr Trump attacked in particular Germany, his favorite target, accused of being \"completely controlled by Russia\" because of its gas supplies, aiming at the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany. \"I am very concerned about the pipeline, I do not like the gas pipeline,\" he insisted Thursday. \"For me, it was a very important point of contention, we discussed it for a long time,\" he added, adding that Germany had agreed to \"do much better\" in terms of military spending. she did it and we are very happy about it. \"I explained that in Germany we know we have to do more and we have been doing this for some time,\" said German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"But I also made it clear that we are the second largest supplier of NATO troops,\" she added. The White House tenant is due to visit the United Kingdom for a meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday before a historic bilateral summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday. He assured that he would discuss with Mr. Putin the Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. \"We will ask questions about Syria, I will ask about interference, your favorite question,\" he told a reporter. \"All I can do is say: + did you do it? + And + do not do it again + He can deny,\" he said. Vladimir Putin \"is not my enemy (...) In the end, he is a competitor, he represents Russia, I represent the United States,\" he said.

World News US Federal Court Document Shows Indictment Against Wikileaks Founder Assange Published 2 days ago on November 16, 2018 By ANN A US federal court document showed on Thursday that prosecutors have obtained a sealed indictment against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, whose website published thousands of classified U.S. government documents. The document, which prosecutors say was filed by mistake, asks a judge to seal documents in a criminal case unrelated to Assange, and carries markings indicating it was originally filed in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia in August. A source familiar with the matter said the document was initially sealed but unsealed this week for reasons that are unclear at the moment. On social network Twitter, Wikileaks said it was an \"apparent cut-and-paste error.\" U.S. officials had no comment on the disclosure in the document about a sealed indictment of Assange, the charges facing whom are unclear. The document is part of an unrelated criminal case involving a 29-year-old man charged with enticing a 15-year-old girl. In that case, the judge wrote in a detention memo that the defendant, Seitu Sulayman Kokayi, \"has had a substantial interest in terrorist acts.\" Reuters was unable to immediately trace contact details for Kokayi. But Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the prosecutors' office which filed the document that was unsealed, told Reuters, \"The court filing was made in error. That was not the intended name for this filing.\" Reuters was unable to immediately reach Assange or his lawyers to seek comment. Prosecutors sought to keep the charges confidential until after Assange's arrest, the document shows, saying the move was essential to ensure he did not evade or avoid arrest and extradition in the case. Any procedure \"short of sealing will not adequately protect the needs of law enforcement at this time because, due to the sophistication of the defendant, and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged,\" the document reads. It adds, \"The complaint, supporting affidavit, and arrest warrant, as well as this motion and the proposed order, would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter.\" U.S. officials have previously acknowledged that federal prosecutors based in Alexandria have been conducting a lengthy criminal investigation into WikiLeaks and its founder. Representatives of the U.S. administration of President Donald Trump, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have publicly called for Assange to be aggressively prosecuted. Assange and his supporters have periodically said U.S. authorities had filed secret criminal charges against him, an assertion against which some U.S. officials pushed back until recently. Facing extradition from Britain to Sweden to be questioned in a sexual molestation case, Assange six years ago took refuge in Ecuador's London embassy, where initially he was treated as a welcome guest. But following a change in the government of the south American nation, Ecuadorean authorities last March began to crack down on his access to outsiders and for a time cut off his internet access.

More than two years since the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU in a shock referendum, it is still unclear how, on what terms or even if it will leave the EU as planned on March 29, 2019. Ever since winning the top job in the turmoil that followed the 2016 referendum, May has sought to negotiate a Brexit deal that ensures that the United Kingdom leaves in the smoothest way possible. But Brexit minister Dominic Raab resigned over her deal, sending the pound tumbling. Mutinous lawmakers in her own party openly sought to challenge her leadership and bluntly told her that the Brexit deal would not pass parliament. Asked if she would contest any challenge to her position, May replied: \"Am I going to see this through? Yes.\" She is due to speak on LBC radio at 0800 GMT. On Friday, it was not clear whether Michael Gove, the most prominent Brexit-supporting minister in her government, would stay on as environment minister after May offered him the job of Brexit minister, British newspapers reported. Brexit will pitch the world's fifth largest economy into the unknown. Many fear it will divide the West as it grapples with both the unconventional U.S. presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. Amid the deepest political turmoil since the Suez canal crisis, when in 1956 Britain was forced by the United States to withdraw its troops from Egypt, the ultimate outcome remains uncertain. Scenarios include May's deal ultimately winning approval; May losing her job; Britain leaving the bloc with no agreement; or even another referendum. The EU and Britain need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world's biggest trading bloc and the United Kingdom, home to the biggest international financial center. Supporters of Brexit say that while the divorce might bring some short-term instability, in the longer term it will allow the United Kingdom to thrive and also enable deeper EU integration without such a powerful reluctant member. By seeking to preserve the closest possible ties with the EU, May has upset her party's many advocates of a clean break, and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up her minority government. Meanwhile, proponents of closer relations with the EU in her own party and the Labour opposition say the deal squanders the advantages of membership for little gain. The deal will need the backing of about 320 of parliament's 650 lawmakers to pass. \"It is ... mathematically impossible to get this deal through the House of Commons. The stark reality is that it was dead on arrival,\" said Conservative Brexit-supporting lawmaker Mark Francois.

Oil prices have risen 45 per cent since Macron took office in mid-2017 and his government is facing pressure on high prices from grassroots movement protesting recent petrol tax hikes. He said on Wednesday: \"When I talked at length with Donald Trump on Saturday in Paris, we together took the decision to put pressure on Saudi Arabia and other producers to limit prices.\" \"If you look at prices these last few days, oil prices are starting to fall and I hope that this fall will continue,\" he added. Oil prices rose nearly two per cent on Wednesday, recovering some lost ground the previous day amid signs that OPEC and allied producers may cut output next month to boost prices.

The U.S. president's many critics call him a dictator lover who is deliberately trying to upend the post-1945 world order. But a simpler explanation is that he is doing what he promised: reconfiguring that world order so America gets more benefit.U.S. President Donald Trump attends a meeting of the North Atlantic Council during a summit of heads of state and government at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday. (Geert Vanden Wijngaert/Associate / Geert Vanden Wijngaert/Associate)Trump went through the Brussels NATO summit this week like a one-man wrecking crew. He demanded, insulted and complained.He took credit for things that didn't happen -- most notably a non-existent promise by the allies to spend more than two per cent of their entire economic output on defence -- and praised himself as a \"very stable genius.\"Like the 28 other NATO leaders in attendance, Trump signed a summit declaration that singled out Russian meddling in Europe as a major threat to world peace.Article Continued Below\"There can be no return to 'business as usual' until there is a clear constructive change in Russia's attitudes,\" the 23-page declaration readBut Trump clearly didn't mean it. And in his own rambling way, he raised a legitimate question: If NATO members think Russia is so bad, why do they continue to do business with the country?In particular, why are they pushing ahead with an undersea pipeline project to double the amount of natural gas that Russia sells directly to Western Europe?The story of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline illustrates all of the contradictions of NATO's approach to Russia. Eastern European members in particular see Russia' annexation of Crimea, as well as its meddling in the affairs of former Soviet republics, such as Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, as a direct threat.Yet much of Europe is reliant on Russian natural gas. Germany gets 40 per cent of its gas from Russia, France 25 per cent. Overall, about 37 per cent of Europe's natural gas comes from Russia.Currently, most Russian gas exports to Europe are carried on east-west pipelines running through countries such as Poland and Ukraine. But commercial and political disputes have made some of these lines unreliable.A 2009 dispute between Russia and Ukraine led to a 13-day disruption of gas to Western Europe -- in the middle of winter. That, in turn, increased pressure on the Europeans to go ahead with Nord Stream 1, a pipeline built under the Baltic Sea and running from Russia directly to Germany. It was completed by 2011.Article Continued BelowThen came Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. Europe, the U.S. and Canada responded by levying limited economic sanctions against Russia.But no one in Western Europe was anxious to curtail the flow of Russian natural gas. Indeed, plans for a second undersea pipeline from Russia to Germany, Nord Stream 2, were soon under way.That pipeline is being built by the Russian energy giant Gazprom. Big German, French, Dutch and Austrian companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, are involved in the financing. It's due to be completed in 2020.Trump argued in Brussels that it makes no sense for America to pick up the bulk of the cost of defending Germany from Moscow when the Germans themselves are engaged in a massive business deal with Russia. He has a point.But the broader point is this: How can Russia be both a threat to NATO countries and their business partner? The question is most obviously directed at Germany and France. Yet Canada, Iceland, Norway the U.S. and Denmark are happy to have a business-as-usual relationship with Russia in the Arctic -- regardless of what the NATO declaration they signed says.Trump has long argued that Russia need not be treated as an implacable enemy. That's why he is meeting Putin on Monday in Finland.In this new cold war climate, the idea of making an accommodation with Moscow may seem odd. But the bumptious U.S. president has it right. Russia is a big country with its own interests. It is not Satan.Thomas Walkom is a Toronto-based columnist covering politics.

Listen here. In a surprising change of tone, Israel has expressed readiness to reopen the Quneitra border crossing with Syria in the Golan Heights, now that the Arab country's armed forces have purged militant groups from there. \"We are ready to open the crossing as it was before, and now the ball is in the Syrian court,\" Israeli minister for military affairs Avigdor Lieberman told reporters as he toured the border area on Thursday. Lieberman, who has a long history of hurling threats of doom and destruction against Syria and President Bashar al-Assad, added that Israel never wanted conflict with Syria and was ready to ensure a 1974 armistice agreement between the two sides is strictly observed. \"We said from the beginning that we have no interest in meddling in the ... war within Syria and we have never intervened. What interests us is ensuring the security\" of Israelis, Lieberman said. The Golan Heights is a Syrian territory, which Tel Aviv has been occupying since 1967 and claims as its own territory despite international criticism. In August, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) returned to the border between Syria and the occupied territories, four years after it was shuttered due to militant attacks.

That's the question I've been getting a lot of lately.

I happen to be one of a handful of people on the left who has never bought into this half baked conspiracy theory, cooked up by Democrats to explain how they lost the White House to a reality TV monster and picked up by the so-called intelligence community to justify their purse shriveling budgets. But still I get asked, usually by some limp-wristed Whole-Foods progressive, what if Putin did it? Since I've grown blue in the face trying to explain to these well intentioned morons that after 18+ months the worst thing that the biggest investigation since Watergate has managed to uncover is a mercenary Slavic clickbait farm and the kind of casual run-ins with Russian oligarchs that are sadly de rigueur for existence in the Washington swamplands, I figured I might as well just answer the goddamn question, which has developed a vibrant new layer of cacophony in the wake of Robert Mueller's latest wave of baseless indictments against Russian nationals who will never stand trial.

Listen here. NATO nations have agreed to satisfy the US demand to increase defense spending. This is what US President - Donald Trump - said at a press conference in Brussels during the second day of the NATO summit. President Trump reiterated his earlier request for doubling defense spending target, saying that four per cent of gross domestic product was - quote - the right number. Radio Sputnik discussed Trump's calls to NATO allies to increase defense spending to 4 % of GDP with Keith Preston, the chief editor and director of attackthesystem.com. READ MORE June 11, 2018 Henry Kissinger has 'advised Donald Trump to accept' Crimea as part of Russia Reply by Keith Preston * Anti-Imperialism/Foreign Policy * Tags: Crimea, donald trump, Henry Kissinger, Rex Tillerson, Russia Kissinger represents a ruling class faction that wants to extend the olive branch to Russia in order to create conflict within the BRIICS axis. Tillerson was also associated with that faction, and that's why Tillerson was initially chosen as Sec of State. When Tillerson was forced out it was a sign that the Deep State faction was gaining the upper hand in the Trump administration. The Deep State is more concerned with protecting the cash flow and power base of the military-industrial-intelligence apparatus, so they always need an official enemy to be at war with. Reviving the Cold War with Russia is a good means to that end. Kissinger represents the uber-globalist faction of the elite that 's more about consolidating the empire on the international level by subsuming unruly provinces and bringing them into the fold, or dividing and conquering them when that doesn't work. See here. By Andrew Buncombe The Independent Is the veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger working to secure a rapprochement between the US and Moscow by pushing for an end to sanctions in exchange for the removal of Russian troops from eastern Ukraine? A flurry of reports suggest the 93-year-old diplomat is positioning himself as a intermediary between Vladimir Putin and President-elect Donald Trump. He has publicly praised Mr Trump, and traveled to Trump Tower in New York to offer his counsel built on decades of lobbying and diplomacy. A report in the German tabloid Der Bild headlined 'Kissinger to prevent new Cold War', claimed the former envoy was working towards a new relationship with Russia. This would involve the US accepting that Crimea, a Ukrainian territory that Russia seized in March 2014, now belongs to Moscow. In exchange, Russia would remove troops and military supplies to rebels in eastern Ukraine which have fighting a war against the Ukrainian government. The report did not provide details, but claimed that \"sources\" said that Mr Kissinger was drawing up a \"master plan\" for Ukraine.

Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem (File photo) Lebanon's Hezbollah resistance movement downplays threats of a military action against Syria, ruling out a potential direct confrontation between the US and Russia or a wider war in the Arab country. \"We rule out the situation developing into a direct American-Russian clash or a wide state of war,\" Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem told Lebanese daily al-Joumhouria in an interview published on Friday. \"The conditions do not point to a total war happening ... unless (US President Donald) Trump and (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu completely lose their minds,\" he said. Hezbollah, along with Russia and Iran, has been helping the Syrian army in its battles against terrorists. The US and its allies have been threatening Damascus with military action since April 7, when a suspected chemical attack on the Syrian town of Douma, Eastern Ghouta, reportedly killed 60 people and injured hundreds more. The possibility of an attack grew larger on Wednesday, after Trump warned Russia, one of Syria's key supporters in the fight against foreign-backed militancy, to \"get ready\" to shoot down American missiles over Syria soon. The US, however, later muddied the threats as a number of its major European allies, including Germany, said they would not join such a military action. PressTV-Trump muddies Syria threats as Europeans balk The US president refuses to act on threats of waging war on Syria as major European powers say they will not be joining Washington. Syria has firmly denied any links to the chemical attack. Both Moscow and Damascus have invited the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to send a fact-finding mission to Douma and investigate the alleged use of chemical weapons there. Damascus has destroyed its entire chemical weapons stockpile under a UN-brokered program overseen by the OPCW. Syrians shrug off US threats On Thursday, some Syrians in the capital Damascus shrugged off the possibility of a US strike against the government of President Bashar al-Assad. A Damascus resident said \"Russia will respond\" and another one dismissed the idea of missile attack saying US is \"afraid of Russia and China.\" \"They are only threats. They always threaten us. It is not the first time. It is not something new. We got used to it. Russia will respond,\" said Eugenie Saadeh. February 26, 2018 Keith Preston: US colonizes Europeans via NATO, military assistance Reply by Keith Preston * Anti-Imperialism/Foreign Policy * Tags: Russia Press TV. Listen here. The United States has been able to colonize European countries by spending money to keep them secure while also selling them weapons, says an analyst in Virginia. Keith Preston, the director of AttackTheSystem.com made the remarks while discussing reports that the US has been able to sell billions of dollars in weapons to Europe by spreading fear of an alleged Russian threat. \"The European nations are essentially the military colonies of the United States through NATO,\" Preston told Press TV on Sunday. \"While those nations are certainly sovereign nations in a political context, on a military level they are heavily dependent on NATO for their military defense.\" Pointing to the small military budgets of NATO members, Preston argued that the without Washington's contributions to the military alliance European countries would basically have no military defense.

December 26, 2017 China and Russia Train for War with U.S. if Trump Invades North Korea 1 by Keith Preston * Anti-Imperialism/Foreign Policy, Fourth Generation Warfare, Military, Uncategorized * Tags: China, North Korea, Russia The withering away of the antiwar movement during the Obama era, and the failure of the Left to oppose the Trump administration's efforts to strengthen the position of the Atlanticist-Zionist-Wahhabi axis (or to even take notice) indicates that US imperialism will have to be defeated externally rather than internally. This will be achieved by a combination of ongoing military defeats by fourth generation warfare forces, and the rise of counter power on a geopolitical level. On the former point, the US is now 0-5 in the 4GW conflicts that have been fought over the last quarter century (Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria). Meanwhile, the \"triangular resistance\" of the BRICS, Shia-led Resistance Block, and the Global South is rising to create a multipolar rather than unipolar world. The US has largely retreated from Latin America, and will gradually do the same in Asia and Africa in the future. By Tom O'Connor Newsweek China and Russia may be devising a plan to attack U.S. forces in the event of an imminent war breaking out on the neighboring Korean Peninsula, according to two former military officials. Lieutenant General Wang Hongguang, the former deputy commander of the western Nanjing Military Region, warned \"the war on the Korean Peninsula might break out anytime between now and March next year\"; his comments came during a conference hosted Saturday by ruling Communist Party newspaper The Global Times. The following day, the nationalist outlet expanded on the retired general's remarks with insight from Chinese military expert, commentator and author Song Zhongping, who said China could potentially engage U.S. forces if they posed a threat.

Listen here. US President Donald Trump's plans to reduce Washington's foreign interventionism and focus on issues like immigration are part of a foreign policy plan that seeks to separate Russia from China and Iran, says an American analyst. Keith Preston, director of attackthesystem.org, made the remarks while discussing Trump's directives to curb immigration. On Wednesday, the new president signed executive orders to begin the construction of a wall on the border with Mexico and to crack down on states that harbor immigrants. Following his campaign pledge to ban Muslims from entering America, Trump is also expected to sign another executive order which blocks the entry of Syrian refugees and suspends the entry of any immigrants from Syria and other Muslim countries like Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Libya and Yemen. \"He is apparently going to follow through with many things he said he was going to do on the campaign trail and I think primarily what he is aiming to do right now is to establish his own credibility,\" Preston told Press TV on Wednesday..

January 25, 2017 Trump Will Try to Smash the China-Russia-Iran Triangle: Here's Why He Will Fail Reply by Keith Preston * Anti-Imperialism/Foreign Policy * Tags: China, donald trump, foreign policy, Iran, Russia The best analysis of the Trumpian approach to foreign policy I have seen to date. By Pete Escobar South China Morning Press China, Russia and Iran are the three key players in what promises to be the Eurasian Century. Donald Trump may be The Joker; The Fool; The Ace of Spades; the ultimate trickster. What nobody can tell for sure is how this shifty chameleon will seduce, cajole, divide and threaten these three countries in his bid to \"Make America Great Again\". Considering the composition of his cabinet, as well as his motormouth twittering, the world according to Trump sees radical Islam as the No 1 threat, followed by Iran, China and Russia. The strategy of Henry Kissinger, Trump's unofficial foreign policy guru, is a mix of \"balance of power\" and \"divide and rule\". It will consist of seducing Russia away from its strategic partner China; keeping China constantly on a sort of red alert; and targeting Islamic State while continuing to harass Iran. All this has the potential to backfire splendidly. Even a real \"reset\" with Russia, of the non-Hillary Clinton kind, is not exactly assured. Is a Trump-Putin bromance enough for a miracle in US-Russia ties? Trump's pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, may in fact be a cipher, a privileged ExxonMobil dealmaker, or a Trojan Horse for Kissinger's views. Tillerson is a trustee of the hardline Centre for Strategic and International Studies think tank, along with Kissinger.

Listen here. The American intelligence community is seeking to cause \"friction\" between the United States and Russia as President-elect Donald Trump has signaled willingness to improve relations with Moscow, says a political analyst. Keith Preston, the chief editor of AttacktheSystem.com, made the remarks on Wednesday in an interview with Press TV when asked about new legislation introduced in the Senate to impose sweeping new sanctions on Russia. Five Democrats and five Republicans unveiled the new punishments on Tuesday after the intelligence community concluded in a report that the Russian government had sought to influence the outcome of the November election through cyberhacking and a smear campaign, a claim that Trump and Moscow have both rejected. \"It's extraordinarily foolish for the American Congress to try to impose any kind of sanctions on Russia on the grounds that Russia has supposedly interfered in the American election, that has not been proven,\" Preston said. \"The intelligence services are trying to create a greater degree of friction between the United States and Russia, and the Democratic Party is going along with this, in part because they want to blame the Russians for their loss in the election,\" he added. The proposed legislation would solidify many of the sanctions President Barack Obama's outgoing administration has imposed against Russia and limit Trump's ability to improve relations with Moscow. Preston said, \"the intelligence services and the political establishment are trying to undermine (Trump)'s efforts to bring the United States closer to Russia,\" adding, \"they have allies in Congress, particularly in the Democratic Party\" to help them achieve their goal. He said one reason they do not want better ties with Russia is that \"the military industrial complex wants to expand NATO right up the Russia's border and they also want to circle Russia with military bases in Central Asia.\" More... January 1, 2017 Keith Preston: McCain not credible to comment on Russia alleged hack Reply by Keith Preston * Uncategorized * Tags: John McCain, Russia Press TV. Listen here. US Senator John McCain, an 80-year-old Republican from Arizona, is \"not credible\" to comment on Russia's alleged hacking efforts against the United States presidential election, which gave Donald Trump control over the White House, an analyst says. Keith Preston, the chief editor and director of AttacktheSystem.com, made the remarks in a Saturday interview with Press TV, while commenting on McCain's statement following a meeting with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko during a visit to the capital Kiev. The West accuses Moscow of meddling in the crisis in eastern Ukraine and capturing the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, where people voted to join the Russian Federation in a referendum in March 2014. McCain, who is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has been using the recent escalation with Russia over hacking allegations, as a pretext to attack Moscow. \"We have to make sure that there is a price to pay so that we can perhaps persuade Russians to stop this kind of attacks on our very fundamentals of democracy,\" he said in Keiv on Friday, calling Russia's hacking and \"act of war.\" \"John McCain is not a credible figure. He is a front man for a political faction in the United States, called the neoconservatives. And these people have a very antagonistic attitude towards Russia... and nations in the Middle East that reject the Washington consensus,\" Preston said. In the run-up to the 2016 vote, WikiLeaks kept releasing batches of emails from the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as well as the Democratic National Committee. Democrats pointed the finger at Russia, an allegation later confirmed by the FBI and the CIA. According to Preston, \"none of this has ever been proven; all of these are simply allegations; the government of the United States has never issued any definitive proof, indicating that Russia was in any way responsible for the things that they (Russians) are being accused of.\" Apart from that, noted the Virginia-based journalist, the US has \"interfered in the domestic politics of other nations more times than we can count; I mean the United States has organized coups against the elected governments.\" Moscow has rejected any interference in the US 2016 presidential election through hacking.

At least, Trump's approach has so far avoided the drift toward Cold War 2 that might have happened had Hillary Clinton become president, but Trump's trade war mentality may hasten the advent of a different kind of second Cold War, with China and Europe at its epicenter, that is, if the Trump presidency is not undermined in the November elections or otherwise. We should be puzzled by the seeming passivity of the deep state in the U.S. Does it not exist after all? Q1: What are the reasons for Trump's insistence that NATO is just another extension of corruption and an institutional burden for the United States? RF: It is difficult to evaluate Trump's particular moves from coherent rational perspectives. He seems driven by narcissistic motivations of various sorts that have little to do with any overall grand strategy, and a diplomatic style that he has managed to impose on the conduct of American foreign policy that consists of provocative bluster and insults of respected foreign leaders, a continuation of the sort of vulgar irreverence that brought him unexpected success on the presidential campaign trail in 2016 and earlier celebrity in the deal-making world of real estate, gambling casinos, beauty pageants, professional boxing, and reality TV (\"The Apprentice\"). Explaining Trump's recent confrontational focus on financial contributions by NATO members seems as simple as this at first glance, but of course, such assessments based on personality never tell the whole story in the complex unfolding political narrative. Undoubtedly, another part of the story can be associated with the insistence during a Trump's interview that Europe is a trade rival of the United States. A further conjecture may be a geopolitical 'peace' framework based on Russia, China, and the U.S.. With regard to NATO, Trump has a clear target related to two things he seems to love, and admittedly such affections were not alien to the foreign policy he inherited from his predecessors: money and weapons. By showing that he can gain what Obama failed to achieve with respect to meeting the agreed 2% of GDP goal set for NATO members, he can, and certainly will, boast of his greater effectiveness in protecting America's material interests than prior presidents. As suggested he measures foreign policy success by reference to monetary returns and America, First (and Me, First) criteria, and tends to put to one side the solidarities of friendship among countries sharing a common cultural identity and mutual respect that have been at the core of the alliance ethos over the decades, especially in relations with Western Europe since World War II. Richard Falk For Trump it appears that alliances, including even NATO, are to be treated as nothing more than business arrangements that are only worthwhile so long as their profit margins hold up. This means that financial contributions become the clearest test of whether cooperative frameworks makes sense in present settings. Interests and values are put to one side while the bundles of cash are counted. In such a process, the circumstances that brought the alliance into being, or justify its continuation, are ignored. Actually, Trump could make a credible case for withdrawing from or greatly downsizing the alliance, given present world conditions, which would help reduce the U.S. fiscal deficit, as well as easing the burdens of security that fall to Washington. In the end, Trump could credibly claim a narrow victory for himself at this recent NATO summit in the transactional sense of gaining assurances from the European governments that they will be increasing their defense budgets. In return Trump reaffirmed continuing U.S. support for the NATO alliance. Like a Mafioso family gathering when the cash flow is restored, friendship between European governments and Trump's America becomes again possible, providing foreign leaders are prepared to continue absorbing the insults Trump delivers along the way, and then when they create awkward moments, as with Teresa May in Helsinki, are curtly dismissed as his own 'fake news.' When 'fake' is used to discredit the truth, trust vanishes, and one of the pillars of a healthy democracy is destroyed. We gradually lose our understanding of what is truth, and worse, no longer care or hold leaders accountable by reference to reality. There is no indication of any attention given by Trump to the crucial question: whether NATO serves sufficient useful purposes in the post-Cold War world to be worth the economic costs, let alone the political costs associated with spending on weapons rather than the well-being of people and their natural surroundings. Would not the long overdue transition to a real peacetime security posture have many positive advantages for the U.S. and Europe, including exploring prospects for a mutually beneficial cooperative relationships with Russia and China? We have reached a stage in world history where we should be asking whether NATO might be abandoned altogether or drastically redesigned in light of the current agenda of actual global policy challenges. If NATO were converted into a vehicle for the realization of human security, setting its new agenda by reference to the well-being of people, it would be a genuine triumph for Trump and the global public interest, but such an orientations seems well outside the boundaries of his political imagination. In fairness, no American leader has dared to adopt the discourse of human security, or questioned the continued viability of Cold War alliances and accompanying strategic doctrine, and it would be pure wishful thinking to expect such demilitarizing words to issue from the lips or mind of Donald Trump. At least those of us who watch the Trump spectacle in bemused fear should more than ever put forward our own hopes and beliefs in broad gauged cooperation between North America and Europe based on a commitment to peace, justice, and security, and demand that discussion of the future of the relationship between Europe and North America not be reduced to a demeaning debate about how to raise the level of military spending or keep obsolete alliances in being by the artifice of worrying only about whether particular governments are meeting the 2% goal, which seems like an arbitrary number that is unrelated to the actuality of security challenges. Q2: How do you forecast the European reaction to the Trump commentary on NATO and could you explain how this might impact key portions of US foreign affairs? RF: Europe's governmental response to the Trump onslaught so far has been very disappointing, while recent civil society responses in Europe has been generally encouraging. On the one side, NATO leaders seem to pout like aggrieved children, angered and humiliated, but too frightened of the uncertainties associated with confronting Trump to raise their objections above the level of a whisper. On the other side, their acquiescence to the Trump insistence that NATO viability is to be measured in dollars or maybe Euros, unaccompanied by even a pretense of putting forward a relevant substantive rationale for Cold War levels of spending. Such passive aggressive behavior by European leaders is likely best understood as a sullen endorsement of Trumpism. In effect, the Europeans are muttering \"yes, we in Europe should be allocating more of our resources to the defense budget and begin to live up to our 2% commitment\" so as to keep a renewed watchful eye on Russia and go along with the slouch toward a Second Cold War. There is no justification given for supposing that Europe will be safer if more heavily invested in military equipment, and my view is that Europe would be far safer, more secure, and more serene if it instead invested these additional funds in helping alleviate the refugee challenge at both the asylum end and at its various sources where combat and climate change have made some national habitats virtually unlivable. It might be emphasized that these habitants from which people are escaping to Europe most commonly at great risk to themselves, have been rendered uninhabitable partly by industrialization in the West and by the bloody aftermath of European colonialism that left behind arbitrary borders that did not correspond to natural communities. Responding to the root causes of refugee and migration pressures should be seen as a matter of long deferred collective responsibility, and not as charity or as exercises of discretion. Furthermore, if NATO were responsive to real threats to the security of Europe, including to its democratic way of life, it would focus its attention with a sense of urgency on these issues instead of implicitly preparing the continent for a new Cold War that an anti-Russian weaponized foreign policy will, ironically, help bring about, initially no doubt in the form of a destablizing arms race, and calls for raising defense spending to even higher levels. Here Trump seems to have his priorities confused. At times, for instance in supporting Brexit, and now endorsing a hard Brexit and the Boris Johnson approach, Trump seems to be furthering Moscow's prime aim of weakening the unity of Europe, while at the same time by rallying NATO members to increase military spending Trump seems to be lending credibility to Russian worries of a new Cold War. Whether for personal reasons associated with his shady financial dealings and his vulnerability to blackmail or a sense that the way to bring stability to the world is to have strong leaders work together, and establish a grand alliance of autocrats, Trump's soft spot for Putin may be preferable to what a hard-edged, NATO enthusiast like Hilary Clinton would have brought to the White House had she won the election. A Clinton presidency would almost certainly have gone easy on NATO when it comes to the economics and politics of burden-sharing while insisting on the adoption of a hardline on such geopolitical issues as Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Given the recent show of timidity by NATO leaders scared to cut the umbilical cord that has tied their security policies to the diktats of Washington ever since 1945 (with the notable exception of DeGaulle's 'France, First' leadership). We sometimes forget that aspiring to the role of global leader has always come with a high price tag, but the expense involved is more than offset by the benefits of status, heightened influence in global arenas, and a favorable positioning in the world economy, or so it seemed to the political elites of both parties until Trump through handfuls of sand into the intricate machinery of the national security state. Q3: In the past US led and authorized NATO bombings are criticized rather easily and justifiably from the left, but what is the danger of the Trump mentality to foster a disregard for global order from the reactionary right wing? And does resistance to Trump cynicism put NATO skeptics on the left in a difficult position in your view? RF: I think that the ideological discourse has definitely been altered by Trump's alt-right approach to NATO. The left, such as it is, has refocused its energies on resisting what it believes to be a slide toward fascism at home arising from its correct perceptions of the Trump presidency as racist, ultra-nationalist, chauvinist, Islamophobic, subverting constitutionalism, and haunted by demagogic leadership. Those most upset with the attacks on the alliance underpinnings of NATO are not the left, but rather the more centrist liberal constituencies encompassing moderate Republicans as well as mainstream Democrats. These are persons likely as upset by the challenge mounted by the mildly insurgent left-leaning politics of Bernie Sanders as by Trump, perhaps more so. Trump is ardently pro-business, pushed through Congress tax reform that mainly benefits those, like himself, who are part of a tiny billionaire class. What remains of the liberal establishment, whether on Wall Street or situated in the dark inner and hidden recesses of the deep state, is on the verge of tears in the aftermath of Trump's assault on the NATO anchoring of the Atlanticist approach to American foreign policy that became so iconic for the political classes comprising the bipartisan American establishment ever since 1945. Q4: Trump was elected partly because of what amounts to his \"Me First\" Doctrine as well as his \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. Does he in your estimation fully intend to utilize NATO in the background while appeasing his rabid anti institution base? Trump and his fanatical base in the U.S. never seem far apart. Even in pursuing trade wars around the world, especially with China, that harm many of those who voted for him, his rationalizations, invoking the 'America, First' language and jobs rhetoric whether or not the evidence supports such claims. Apparently, so far, a relentless demagogue can fool many of the people all the time, especially by the rants of a populist politic that takes delight in scapegoating outsiders and arousing rage against the insiders who are portrayed as reaping the benefits of the international liberalism that gave us both the Cold War world economy and produced a neo-liberal predatory aftermath identified in the 1990s as 'globalization', a view of political legitimacy that combines a private sector economy with some minimal form of democracy. How NATO will eventually fit within this Trump scheme is not yet clear, and may never be so. It seems a blustery sideshow at this point as NATO does not seem to have clear missions in post-Cold War Europe except to be a rallying center for counter-terrorist tactics, which operationally depend on national policing and paramilitary capabilities. It seems that Europe is willing to pay up to sustain the NATO status quo, allowing Trump to laugh his way to the bank. NATO's leading members are most worried these days about keeping the EU together in the face of various stresses associated with Brexit, refugees, a far right anti-immigration resurgence, and some loss of confidence in the Euro and austerity fiscal discipline. Handling Trump is an unpleasant additional chore for European leaders, but it is so far treated more in the spirit of the London protesters' giant baby balloon, a matter of parenting, lacking real substantive weight, or so it seems. Aside from Turkey no European government seems to be considering alternative alignments now. On the broader posture of anti-institutionalism and anti-multilateralism, Trump has kept faith with his pre-Fascist base by bullying tactics at the UN, repudiating the Nuclear Agreement with Iran, and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Change Agreement. These are big ticket items that represent extremely serious setbacks for responsible efforts to address challenges of regional and global scale that pose severe threats to peace and ecological stability. Q5: Trump likes to portray himself as a populist alternative to the Bushes and Clintons and their reckless foreign policy while questioning our \"exceptionalism.\" In reality however we have broadened and expanded our presence around the world under Trump. Can you talk about the Trump foreign policy and how'd you categorize it? Trump foreign policy, such as it is, seeks to diminish engagement with international institutions, including treaty regimes, and retain greater freedom of maneuver for the U.S. Government in international relations. It seems also to deny the reality of such global challenges as climate change, global migrations, genocidal behavior, and extreme poverty. It is definitely statist in outlook, both because of a belief in nationalism as the best guide to policy-making and problem solving, and because the United States as the richest and most powerful of states can supposedly gain greater advantages for itself by reliance on its superior bargaining leverage in any bilateral bargaining process. Borrowing from his deal-making past, Trump seems convinced that the U.S. will get more of what it wants when it deals bilaterally than in hemmed in my multilateral frameworks as in trade relations or environmental protection. Beyond this kind of transactional search for material advantages, oblivious to substantive realities that make cooperative approaches more likely to achieve beneficial results, Trump has been consistent in promoting reactionary issues at home and abroad whenever given the chance, whether by tweeting or issuing executive orders. While in Europe he gave public voice via TV to an anti-immigration screed, telling Europeans that immigrants were ruining Europe, bringing to the continent crime and terrorism, a malicious argument similar to the slander of undocumented Hispanic immigrants present in the United States, some long in the country, and making laudable contributions. Trump's silences are also important. He seems determined to ignore crimes against humanity if committed by states against people subject to its authority, whether the Rohingya in Myanmar or Palestinians in Gaza. American support for human rights, always subject to geopolitical manipulation, is now a thing of the past so long as Trump hangs around, although such considerations may be cynically invoked when helpful to strengthen arguments for sanctions and uses of force against adversery states. Whether wittingly or not, Trump seems determined to shatter the legacy of the Bushes and Clinton built around an American led liberal international order, but without any real alternative conception of global governance to put in its place. So far this has produced an ad hoc approach, beset by contradictions, which one day can veer in the direction of confrontation as with Iran or North Korea, or on another day seem to seek some sort of long-term accommodation with Russia and North Korea, and sometimes even China. Also evident is the extent to which Trump's foreign policy initiatives are designed to please Israel, as with the move of the American Embassy to Jerusalem announced last December, or the heightened tensions with Iran, or have no justification other than to uphold the expectations of billionaire domestic donors of his presidential campaign. And finally, there is the search for the grandiose, 'the deal of the century,' a breakthrough that will make Trump great for once and for many, but when more closely considered the deal, as the one in the offing to end the Israel/Palestine struggle turns out to be a house of cards, so one-sided that it effectively collapses before its absurdly pro-Israeli contents have been officially disclosed. Whether by his blunt actions sowing discord or his silent acquiescence in the face of atrocities, we have reason to fear the trajectory of the Trump presidency. In this sense, the NATO performance was just a tip of a dangerous iceberg imperiling world order, but also the future of responsible and responsive governance in a period of grave danger and intense turmoil. As with the weak response of European governments to Trumpism, there is reason for disappointment about the resilience of republican institutions within the United States, including such stalwarts as separation of powers and the constitutional integrity of political parties.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2018 \"NATO is now a fine tuned machine,\" Trump said, emphasizing the importance of \"burden sharing.\" Trump added that the US's commitment to NATO \"remains very strong\" and that it would be \"unnecessary\" for the US to walk away from the alliance, as he had threatened to do. While the US shouldering much of the financial burden has been \"unfair,\" Trump praised his partners, saying \"Germany is coming along,\" though \"we need to figure out what is happening with the pipeline\" - a reference to the Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline from Russia, which has been an object of criticism from Trump during this year's conference. Trump praised the \"great collegial spirit\" before reiterating a phrase from earlier this year - telling reporters that he's \"a very stable genius.\" Speaking to reporters after the emergency meeting, Trump said, \"I told people that I'd be very unhappy if they didn't up their financial commitments substantially.\" Turning to the subject of his upcoming meeting with Putin, Trump said that some NATO allies had thanked him for his outreach to Putin. On the subject of Crimea, Trump once again blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, saying \"that wouldn't have happened on my watch.\" As for his relationship with Putin, Trump said the Russian president is a \"competitor\" but that he hoped one day Putin might become \"a friend.\" Ahead of the pressers, Trump told NATO leaders that if they did not meet their defense spending targets of 2 percent of gross domestic product by January, the United States would go it alone, according to two officials briefed on the meeting. * * * EARLIER Update: Headlines are rolling in... *TRUMP SAYS U.S.'S NATO ALLIES ARE RAISING DEFENSE SPENDING *TRUMP SAYS U.S. COMMITMENT TO NATO REMAINS VERY STRONG *TRUMP: NATO MEMBERS HAVE `REALLY STEPPED UP' DEFENSE SPENDING *TRUMP SAYS HE WOULD BE `VERY UNHAPPY' IF ALLIES DON'T PAY MORE *TRUMP SAYS HE WAS `EXTREMELY UNHAPPY' YESTERDAY *TRUMP SAYS NATO BETTER OFF TODAY THAN TWO DAYS AGO *TRUMP SAYS `VERY HAPPY' WITH WHAT GERMANY AGREED TO *TRUMP SAYS HE WAS `VERY FIRM' WITH NATO ALLIES YESTERDAY *TRUMP:KEY NATO TASK IS FOR ALLIES TO SPEND 2% OF GDP ON DEFENSE *TRUMP SAYS UNNECESSARY TO WITHDRAW U.S. FROM NATO *TRUMP CITES `GREAT COLLEGIAL SPIRIT' AT NATO SUMMIT *TRUMP SAYS NATO `PROBABLY THE GREATEST EVER DONE', `FINE-TUNED' *TRUMP SAYS HE'S A 'VERY STABLE GENIUS' *TRUMP SAYS PUTIN `MAY DENY' MEDDLING IN U.S. ELECTIONS *TRUMP SAYS HE'LL ASK PUTIN ABOUT `MEDDLING' *TRUMP: U.S. ALLIES' MILITARY BUDGETS UP `LIKE A ROCKET SHIP' *TRUMP SAYS NATO ALLIES THANKED HIM FOR PLAN TO MEET PUTIN *TRUMP SAYS HE'S NOT HAPPY ABOUT CRIMEA *TRUMP SAYS PUTIN IS A \"COMPETITOR\" *TRUMP SAYS NATO MEETING `WAS A LITTLE TOUGH FOR A LITTLE WHILE' *TRUMP SAYS HE HAS NO MESSAGE ON BREXIT *TRUMP SAYS HE HAS `GREAT RESPECT' FOR HIS CHINESE COUNTERPART *TRUMP SAYS IRAN TREATING U.S. WITH `MUCH MORE RESPECT' NOW * * * President Trump is holding an impromptu press conference in Brussels while his fellow NATO leaders are gathered in an unplanned emergency session. The conference is happening amid reports that Trump threatened to pull the US out of NATO. The speech comes after Trump made a big deal about money and demanded last night that allies meet the 2% threshold immediately, and not by 2024. He has also floated the idea of 'going it alone' if allies don't comply, something which he has said before but he can't really do without an -- unlikely- Congress approval. Finally, he has also suggested the idea of raising the threshold to 4% throwing the summit into turmoil, in much the same way he did at the Group of Seven in Canada.

Trump had already harshly criticized North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations that have failed to hit a target of spending 2 percent of their gross domestic products on defense. On Wednesday, he upped the ante. \"During the president's remarks today at the NATO summit he suggested that countries not only meet their commitment of 2 percent of their GDP on defense spending, but that they increase it to 4 percent,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. \"President Trump wants to see our allies share more of the burden and at a very minimum meet their already stated obligations.\" But it was his scorn for Germany, expressed hours before the summit's official opening and amid domestic political turmoil for Chancellor Angela Merkel, that first grabbed the attention of America's closest allies. Trump said it is not fair to American taxpayers that Germany buys oil and gas from Russia while enjoying the umbrella of defense provided by U.S. dollars. \"Germany is a captive of Russia,\" he said, pointing out that the country pays \"billions and billions of dollars\" to Russia for energy. Trump highlighted that \"Germany is a rich country\" and asked why the U.S. should \"protect you against Russia\" when the two countries are making deals. \"You tell me, is that appropriate?\" he asked, adding that \"Germany is totally controlled by Russia.\" In brief remarks to reporters outside the NATO conference, Merkel asserted that Germany is independent from Russia and contributes to the mutual defense of its member nations, and added that she was prepared to have \"controversial\" discussions. Merkel, who was raised behind the Soviet Union's Iron Curtain in East Germany, also noted pointedly that unified Germany is now free from the yoke of Moscow. Trump's harsh words for the longtime U.S. ally are part of a larger broadside against European nations that the president says are taking advantage of America. His criticism of Germany signaled that he has no intention of easing pressure on alliance nations just because Europe is nervous that tensions could empower Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom Trump is scheduled to meet Monday in Helsinki. German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said later Wednesday that she didn't \"really understand what he means\" by saying her nation is \"captive\" to Russia. \"We have a lot of issues with Russia, without any doubt, but on the other hand you should keep a communication line between countries or alliances and opponents without any question,\" she said. \"So I'm curious to listen in-depth in the meeting what the American president is meaning by that.\" Merkel and Trump, who arrived at the NATO summit via a different entrance than the other world leaders, met privately about 9:15 a.m. ET. The two leaders discussed the pipeline, Trump said when they broke to chat with reporters. He did not elaborate. The meeting was \"great\" and he has a \"very, very good relationship\" with Merkel, Trump said. Speaking in German, Merkel said they discussed trade and migration. Later, Trump held a similar sitdown with French President Emmanuel Macron. After their meeting, Macron was asked if he agreed that Merkel is beholden to Russia. Trump jokingly interjected that he was glad the question had been posed to the French president. Macron deflected, saying he and Trump discussed NATO cooperation. Trump didn't give NATO allies much time to get settled. His fusillade was delivered even before the pomp-filled welcoming ceremony opened the NATO summit, as he and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg spoke to reporters before having breakfast together. While Stoltenberg said a \"strong NATO is good for Europe and good for the United States,\" he tried to temper Trump's criticism of partner nations. \"We have all been able to unite around our core values, that we are all stronger together than apart,\" he said. Trump pushed back. \"How can you be stronger when a country is getting energy from the person you want to protect against?\" the president asked. \"Because we understand when we stand together we are stronger,\" Stoltenberg explained. Trump replied, \"No, you are just making Russia richer.\" The president's comments appeared to be a reference to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would bring gas from Russia to Germany's northeastern Baltic coast, bypassing Eastern European nations like Poland and Ukraine and doubling the amount of gas Russia can send directly to Germany. The vast undersea pipeline is opposed by the U.S. and some other E.U. members, who warn it could give Moscow greater leverage over Western Europe. Earlier, Trump said that he had \"great confidence\" in Stoltenberg, and gave him credit for working to deal with the \"unfair burden\" he said was being footed by the U.S. The line of argument is nothing new for Trump: It's been his most consistent criticism of traditional American allies and one that he made both at a campaign rally in Montana last week and in Washington just before he departed for his trip to Europe. But the message landed differently -- a little more directly -- now that he is in Brussels and meeting face-to-face with the leaders of NATO nations. Trump has turned decades of American diplomacy on its head, former U.S. ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns said Wednesday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \"It's just infuriating to watch this happen,\" Burns said. \"You cannot imagine any American president all the way back 75 years deciding to become the critic-in-chief of NATO. I mean, it's Orwellian. He's making our friends out to be our enemies and he's treating our enemies, like Putin, as our friends.\" In a joint statement issued Wednesday, the top two Democrats in Congress, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, said Trump's behavior at NATO sent a \"profoundly disturbing signal\" that he is \"more loyal to President Putin\" than the alliance. \"If the president leaves the Putin meeting without ironclad assurances and concrete steps toward a full cessation of Russian attacks on our democracy, this meeting will not only be a failure -- it will be a grave step backward for the future of the international order and global security,\" they said. While Trump didn't mention Merkel by name in his remarks early Wednesday, they clashed at last month's G-7 summit, and he later took a swipe at her on Twitter -- wrongly stating that crime was rising in her country because of mass migration. He also referred to Merkel at the Montana event, saying, \"I don't know how much protection we get by protecting you.\" The president's ambassador to NATO, former Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, said last week that the goal of the summit is to project unity. But Trump's demands, and his criticism of Germany, threaten that outcome. Laura Rosenberger, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund and a foreign policy adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, told NBC News that Trump is only helping Russia by exposing and creating fissures within NATO. \"While concerns about Nord Stream 2 are real, accusing Germany of being captive to Russia is patently false -- and frankly feels like a bit of projection coming from Trump,\" Rosenberger said. \"But more broadly, the fact that he chose to start off the summit's events by attacking one of our allies, instead of stressing our unity ... is itself a win for Putin.\" At the end of the day, the NATO heads of state released a 79-point joint declaration that mentioned Russia 56 times, and Stoltenberg said a Wednesday night dinner would focus on Russia. But he demurred when asked about Trump's request that countries reach a new target of spending 4 percent of the size of their individual economies on defense. \"Well, I will focus on what we have agreed, and we have agreed to be committed to the pledge increasing defense spending to 2 percent, and let's start with that,\" he said. \"So we have a way to go, but the good news is we've really started to deliver.\" Source Related Topics:Donald TrumpGermanyNATORussia Up Next Trump's NATO Trip: In Like a Lion, Out Like a Lamb Don't Miss As Migrant Families Are Reunited, Some Children Don't Recognize Their Mothers Continue Reading You may like 11 Hospitalized as Rival Right-wing & Anti-fascist Protests Face off in Chemnitz, Germany (VIDEOS) Donald Trump Chose to Tweet John McCain Tribute 'after Barring Official White House Statement' Trump Rambles about Kanye West and Jim Jordan, but Fails to Mention John McCain in Subdued Ohio Speech Donald Trump is Heading towards Impeachment - and You Have the Power to Make that Happen Poll's 'Insane' Data Shows 64% of Republicans Think a 'Good President' May still Use the N-word Trump in Turmoil: Pressure Mounts on President as Michael Cohen Looks to Make him Suffer over Mueller Probe Click to comment Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

September 9, 2018 Keith Preston: Trump's opposition include 'inside' members Reply by Keith Preston * Culture Wars/Current Controversies * Tags: donald trump, James Mattis Press TV. Listen here. US President Donald Trump has many enemies among fellow members of the Republican Party and his own administration, an American journalist and analyst says. Keith Preston, the chief editor of AttacktheSystem, told Press TV in an interview on Thursday that Trump has many enemies, not only among media and the Democrats, but also, in his own party and his staff. The media depicted Secretary of Defense James Mattis as one of the senior members of the Trump administration who opposed the president and called him an \"idiot\". The journalist cited a new book by renowned investigative journalist Bob Woodward in which Mattis was quoted by his unnamed co-workers as describing Trump as an \"idiot' who \"acted like -- and had the understanding of -- 'a fifth- or sixth-grader'.\" Following the Tuesday release of excerpts of Woodward's book \"Fear: Trump in the White House,\" there were speculations that due to the insults addressed to the president, Mattis would be forced to resign from office. PressTV-Trump wanted Assad assassinated, new book reveals A new book has revealed that the US president allegedly demanded the assassination of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after a 2017 chemical attack that Washington blamed on Damascus.

'Officials working to frustrate Trump agenda' An op-ed in the New York Times (NYT) reveals that senior members of the Trump administration are so worried about the president's impulsive behavior that they actively make efforts to undermine his threatening agenda. The Wednesday report entitled, \"I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,\" is based on the information relayed by an anonymous source. The anonymous source in the report claims that Trump's own staff see him as a national threat and take it upon themselves to safeguard the republic against the president. \"We believe our first duty is to this country, and the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic,\" the anonymous source said in the NYT op-ed. \"Many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.\" Trump described the article as a \"gutless editorial\".

US President Donald Trump may face impeachment proceedings in Congress if the Democratic Party gains the majority after November's midterm congressional elections, an American analyst in Virginia says. \"The crucial issue is the degree to which the Democrats are going to be able to maintain or obtain a substantial majority in the Congress,\" said Keith Preston, chief editor of AttacktheSystem.com. \"If the Democrats are able to gain a lot of seats in the Congress, it's possible that they could move towards the impeachment of the president,\" Preston told Press TV on Tuesday. \"That would of course be extremely controversial,\" similar to the impeachment efforts against former US President Richard Nixon in 1974, which led to his resignation, Preston said.

READ MORE June 19, 2018 How Trump's Republican Party Went Soft on Communism 1 by Keith Preston * Anti-Imperialism/Foreign Policy * Tags: donald trump, Stephen Chapman This columnist is apparently 30 years behind the times. While this article is intended as a bromide against Trump's foreign policy, it actually makes him sound a lot better than he actually is. While Trump's lack of Russophobia, only mild Sinophobia, and willingness to engage in diplomacy with the DPRK is a a good thing,Trump has been more pro-Israel than any US President to date, escalated hostilities with Iran, backed away from Obama's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, and provided billions in arms to the Saudis while they are waging genocide in Yemen and in the Eastern Province. By Stephen Chapman Reason If you had told Ronald Reagan in 1988 that in 30 years, the president of the United States would be chummy with communist dictators in China and North Korea, eager to please a brutal Kremlin autocrat, and indifferent to the needs of our military allies, he might have said: That's what you get for electing a Democrat. Today's Republicans make up a party he wouldn't recognize. For decades, the Russians and Chinese dispatched spies and enlisted American sympathizers to try to harm the United States and tilt its policies in their favor. Under Donald Trump, they don't have to. They have a friend in the Oval Office. It's the most astonishing reversal in modern American political history. Over the past century, the right accused liberals and Democrats of excusing the crimes of Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Fidel Castro. Often, the criticism was well-founded. Harvard's John King Fairbank, the dean of American China scholars, spoke for many on the left in 1972 when he said the communist revolution was \"the best thing that has happened to the Chinese people in centuries.\" President Jimmy Carter, who spurned Americans' \"inordinate fear of communism,\" was shocked by the invasion of Afghanistan. Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, he lamented, \"lied to me.\" READ MORE June 17, 2018 Keith Preston: Trump's willingness to abide by peace agreement with North Korea unclear Reply by Keith Preston * Anti-Imperialism/Foreign Policy * Tags: donald trump, Kim Jong Un, North Korea, Press TV. Keith Preston Press TV. Listen here. The government of North Korea is determined to establishing peaceful relations with the United States and denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, but President Donald Trump's willingness to abide by any agreement is unclear, says an American political analyst in Virginia. \"The regime of [North Korean leader] Kim Jong-un is serious about wanting to make some sort of international peace with the United States for a variety of reasons,\" said Keith Preston, chief editor of AttacktheSystem.com. \"The evidence is that they are indeed sincere about wanting to pursue some sort of agreement with the United States; the question how much the United States going to be willing to give,\" Preston told Press TV on Thursday. Trump said Tuesday Washington was stopping \"very provocative\" and \"very expensive\" military exercises with South Korea to facilitate denuclearization negotiations with North Korea. The United States and South Korea hold regular military drills to the fury of North Korea, which has long seen the drills as preparations to invade it. \"The war games are very expensive, we pay for the majority of them,\" Trump told a news conference on in Singapore after a historic summit with Kim. Trump's announcement was a surprise even to the government of South Korean President Moon Jae-in, which worked in recent months to help bring about the Trump-Kim summit. \"We will be stopping the war games which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should. But we'll be saving a tremendous amount of money, plus I think it's very provocative,\" Trump said. Pentagon officials were not immediately able to provide any details about Trump's remarks about suspending military drills, a step the US military has long resisted. Trump and Kim promised in a joint statement to work toward the \"denuclearization\" of the Korean Peninsula, and the United States promised its Cold War foe security guarantees. Trump and Kim arrived in Singapore on Sunday to hold the first ever face-to-face meeting between leaders of the two countries, which have remained enemies since the 1950-1953 Korean War. While the summit is seen as a test for diplomacy that could end the long-running nuclear standoff, foreign policy experts say the stakes are high if it does not result in a nuclear agreement. June 11, 2018 Henry Kissinger has 'advised Donald Trump to accept' Crimea as part of Russia Reply by Keith Preston * Anti-Imperialism/Foreign Policy * Tags: Crimea, donald trump, Henry Kissinger, Rex Tillerson, Russia Kissinger represents a ruling class faction that wants to extend the olive branch to Russia in order to create conflict within the BRIICS axis. Tillerson was also associated with that faction, and that's why Tillerson was initially chosen as Sec of State. When Tillerson was forced out it was a sign that the Deep State faction was gaining the upper hand in the Trump administration. The Deep State is more concerned with protecting the cash flow and power base of the military-industrial-intelligence apparatus, so they always need an official enemy to be at war with. Reviving the Cold War with Russia is a good means to that end. Kissinger represents the uber-globalist faction of the elite that 's more about consolidating the empire on the international level by subsuming unruly provinces and bringing them into the fold, or dividing and conquering them when that doesn't work. See here. By Andrew Buncombe The Independent Is the veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger working to secure a rapprochement between the US and Moscow by pushing for an end to sanctions in exchange for the removal of Russian troops from eastern Ukraine? A flurry of reports suggest the 93-year-old diplomat is positioning himself as a intermediary between Vladimir Putin and President-elect Donald Trump. He has publicly praised Mr Trump, and traveled to Trump Tower in New York to offer his counsel built on decades of lobbying and diplomacy. A report in the German tabloid Der Bild headlined 'Kissinger to prevent new Cold War', claimed the former envoy was working towards a new relationship with Russia. This would involve the US accepting that Crimea, a Ukrainian territory that Russia seized in March 2014, now belongs to Moscow. In exchange, Russia would remove troops and military supplies to rebels in eastern Ukraine which have fighting a war against the Ukrainian government. The report did not provide details, but claimed that \"sources\" said that Mr Kissinger was drawing up a \"master plan\" for Ukraine.

By Caitlin Johnstone Medium It's been a weird last couple of days. I wrote an article about WikiLeaks' dismissal of \"QAnon\", the anonymous 8chan poster that hundreds of thousands of conspiracy newbies believe is sharing secret, coded information about Donald Trump's heroic war against the US deep state. Ever since I hit publish I've been getting a bunch of angry Q enthusiasts in my social media notifications accusing me of being a shill for the establishment. Because I don't believe someone who says that we should all trust the President of the United States. Blind faith in the executive branch of the US government is anti-establishment now. As bizarre as these interactions have been, they are still vastly more pleasant than my typical interactions with the faction I see as QAnon's mirror image, the Russiagaters. Though enthusiasts of the Russiagate conspiracy theory are far more nasty and vituperative than the Q crowd, there are many similarities. Like QAnon, Russiagate is fueled by about ten percent information and ninety percent desperate need to believe. Like QAnon, Russiagate is so thinly substantiated it doesn't begin to look legitimate until you've spent weeks crawling down the rabbit holes of its bulletproof echo chambers and squinting just right at everything you see until it feels true. Like QAnon, the evangelists of Russiagate center their revolutionary sentiment around President Donald Trump. Like QAnon, they shouldn't.

US President Donald Trump does not deserve the Nobel Peace Prize because his foreign policy is creating tensions in the Middle East, an American journalist says. According to a new poll a majority of Americans believe Trump does not deserve receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. Just 24 percent of registered voters said that Trump deserves the award, compared to 61 percent who said he does not, a Politico/Morning Consult poll released Wednesday found. \"Trump has been in office for almost a year and a half; already during the time he has been in office he has launched two major attacks on Syria - about a year apart - under dubious circumstances. He's also made an enormous arms deal with Saudi Arabia even if Saudi Arabia continues to engage in genocide in Yemen and Saudi Arabia's own eastern province,\" said Keith Preston, chief editor and director of AttacktheSystem.com. PressTV-Most in US say Trump should not get Nobel Peace Prize A majority of Americans believe US President Donald Trump does not deserve receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, a new poll shows. \"Donald Trump has also been more supportive of Israel than probably just about any president of the United Sates has been.\" Preston said US support of the aggressions of Israel and the actions of Saudi Arabia, and also Trump's termination of the nuclear agreement with Iran has nothing to do with promoting global peace and stability. \"The idea that the Trump administration is somehow advancing world peace is nonsense.\" Preston cautioned about overvaluing the Nobel Prize arguing that in the 70s \"Henry Kissinger was given the Nobel Peace Prize even as the United Sates was waging a genocidal war in Southeast Asia.\" \"[Former President] Barack Obama was given a Nobel Peace Prize only a few months after assuming office when he really had done nothing that merited any kind of recognition of that type.\" May 2, 2018 Romney praises Trump's first year in office: It's similar to things 'I'd have done' 1 by Keith Preston * Culture Wars/Current Controversies, Electoralism/Democratism, Left and Right * Tags: donald trump, Mitt Romney Another former Never Trumper admits Trump turned out to be just another moderate Republican/neocon stooge, as all presidents ultimately do if they want to remain alive, out of jail, and employable when they leave office.

By Keith Preston When Donald Trump's seemingly maverick presidential campaign began to accelerate in 2016, both the Left and Right in domestic U.S. politics began to formulate predictable reactions almost on cue. Virtually the entire spectrum of the American right-wing, save the seeming spoil sports of the (neo-Trotskyist) neoconservative milieu, began heralding \"The Donald\" as the savior of (pick one) the American nation, the white race, the free market, the working class, the Christian faith, traditional values, or something or other. Such was the attitude of virtually the entire configuration of the Alt-Right/Lite, ordinary FOX News watching Republican voters, white nationalists, the religious right, and not a few libertarians. Of course, the Left reacted with a parallel reflex, insisting that Trump was the second coming of Hitler, or at least Mussolini or at the bare minimum Franco. In the weeks leading up to the election I was constantly getting messages from right-wing friends saying things like \"Hope you're on the Trump train!\" and from left-wing friends saying \"Hope you're voting against the fascist!\" Of course, being the contrarian that I am, I declined to get aboard any trains, and I voted for the same candidate I always vote for, i.e. the illustrious Nobody.

Listen here. The new shift in US policy in Syria was influenced by President Donald Trump's so-called America First policy that he has advocated since coming to office, says a political analyst. Following Trump's election, \"America First\" has become the official foreign policy doctrine of his administration, which emphasizes American nationalism and anti-interventionism. On Thursday, Trump announced that the US will withdraw from Syria \"very soon.\" One day later, Trump ordered the US State Department to freeze over $200 million in funds for recovery efforts in Syria. Trump's pullback from Syria signals a new strategy amid a reassessment of the role the US should play in the conflict, said Keith Preston, chief editor of AttacktheSystem.com.. The Trump administration has realized that the US-led military campaign in Syria has failed to reach its objective of removing the independent government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Preston told Press TV on Friday. The US has reportedly more than 2,000 troops stationed in eastern Syria, in addition to several thousand others in the Arab country's north. Trump has complained that the US has wasted trillions of dollars in Middle East wars, but gets \"nothing\" in return. More... March 22, 2018 The Trump Administration's Death Penalty Daydream Reply by Keith Preston * Law/Justice, Police State/Civil Liberties, Uncategorized * Tags: death penalty, donald trump, Jeff Sessions, war on drugs I suspect Trump and Sessions' latest efforts to throw a bone to their redneck \"base\" will likely fail, and potentially backfire given that the general trend is toward liberalization of both drug and criminal justice police. By Matt Ford The New Republic In a speech Monday in Manchester, New Hampshire, President Donald Trump enthusiastically backed capital punishment as a tool to fight the opioid epidemic. \"If we don't get tough on the drug dealers, we are wasting our time,\" he said. \"And that toughness includes the death penalty.\" Now, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is trying to put Trump's call into practice. In one-page memo dated Tuesday, Sessions instructed U.S. attorneys nationwide to be more aggressive when prosecuting any drug-related crimes. In addition to the usual tools available to federal prosecutors, he urged them to consider \"the pursuit of capital punishment in appropriate cases.\" To that end, he noted a few specific federal offenses where Congress already authorized the death penalty as a punishment. \"I strongly encourage federal prosecutors to use these statutes, when appropriate, to aid in our continuing fight against drug trafficking and the destruction it causes,\" Sessions wrote. READ MORE March 12, 2018 A President Everyone Can Hate? 5 by Keith Preston * Uncategorized * Tags: donald trump In many ways, Trump is turning out like I hoped he would. It's good to have a guy who acts like a total asshole as head of state, because it's more in keeping with the character of the state. Trump acts and sounds like a New York mafia boss, and this is certainly appropriate given the gangster character of the state as an institution. It was predictable enough that a perceived racist and sexist would certainly draw the hatred of the Left, but the fact that he's essentially a New York liberal at heart who doesn't give a fuck about guns will alienate the populist right, his lack of \"morals\" in his personal life has got to at least make the religious right uncomfortable, his support for tariffs is likely to alienate Chamber of Commerce Republicans, his perceived pro-Russian stance is offensive to the neocons, and his authoritarianism is alienating to libertarians and libertarian-leaning conservatives as well. It's great to have a head of state everyone can potentially hate. Now, when are the supposed \"anarchists\" going to step up to the plate and start organizing real opposition to the state? December 21, 2017 Scott Adams and Dave Rubin: Trump's Persuasion and Presidency 2 by Keith Preston * Uncategorized * Tags: Dave Rubin, donald trump, Scott Adams This is a pretty good discussion of Trump's performance thus far. Now that it's apparent that Trump will more or less govern as a normal, moderate Republican, it appears the neocons have lessened their hostility to him, as the recent headlines and articles at Neocon Review attests. Scott Adams (creator of Dilbert) joins Dave to discuss his newest book \"Win Bigly\" about how Donald Trump used the power of persuasion to win the election, Trumps negotiating strategies and tactics, the trend of 'Trump Derangement Syndrome,' the crumbling mainstream media, the Trump/Russia controversy, his predictions for future candidates and the future of Trump, and more. December 14, 2017 President Trump's 2017 Report Card (first draft) 2 by Keith Preston * Electoralism/Democratism, Left and Right, Uncategorized * Tags: donald trump When Trump was running for President, I predicted that he would govern about like a moderate Republican in the Nixon-Rockefeller tradition, or as a centrist Democrat in the style of Bill Clinton. Apparently, I was right. It's rather embarrassing that so many in the various \"anarchist\" camps have bought into the anti-Trump hysteria. Trumpism is an enemy, but only a peripheral one. The real enemy is the establishment center. Serious anarchists should be just as opposed to neoliberal and progressive Democrats as they are to conservative or populist Republicans. By Scott Adams As we approach the holiday season there will be much debate on how President Trump has performed for his first calendar year. As a populist president, I think the best way to judge his performance is by focusing on the issues voters say are their top priorities. Pew Research polled voters to determine their political priorities for 2017. Let's see how President Trump is doing so far on the top ten priorities according to the public. Terrorism (76% rated top priority) ISIS is on the run, thanks in part to President Trump's loosening of the rules of military engagement, as well as pivoting from a Whack-a-Mole strategy to a total annihilation strategy with no withdrawal date. Both moves are good persuasion. And while President Trump's \"extreme vetting\" is unpopular with many citizens, it has probably reduced risk to the homeland. And General Mattis is widely considered to be a strong hire. Grade: A Economy (73% rated top priority) I'll give President Obama 75% credit for the strong economy. But I think consumer confidence and the stock market tell us there is optimism about the current administration. That confidence is buoyed by Trump's reduction in regulations via executive orders, his tough talk on trade, and his persuasion toward a higher GDP that is already becoming self-fulfilling. If people believe the economy will be better next year than this year, they invest this year, thus making next year better. We might see something good come out of tax reform, but I don't think it will matter as much as people assume.

Listen to the original interview with Press TV here. U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel renders him the \"most pro-Zionist\" commander-in-chief to have ever held the high office, declared Iran's state-controlled news agency Press TV, citing an analyst. State sponsor of terrorism Iran does not recognize Israel's right to exist and has continually threatened to destroy it. The Shiite powerhouse joined various predominantly Muslim countries, jihadist groups like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL), and Pope Francis in condemning President Trump's decision. On Wednesday, Trump announced that the U.S. will recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and has directed his administration to move America's diplomatic mission from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \"I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\" declared Trump. \"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.\" Soon after Trump made his historic decision public, Keith Preston, director of attackthesystem.com, told Press TV: This is not surprising that Trump would make this announcement. One thing that needs to be recognized about the Trump administration's foreign policy is that the Trump administration is zealously pro-Israel. The Trump administration is ardently pro-Zionist, even more, pro-Zionist than many past administrations have been, arguably the most pro-Zionist administration in U.S. history.

US President Donald Trump's use of the name \"Pocahontas\" during a White House ceremony honoring Native American World War II veterans highlights his inclination to insult and abuse people, according to an American analyst. \"Donald Trump has a very well-developed capacity for insulting people; it's almost what he specializes in,\" said Keith Preston, chief editor of AttacktheSystem.com. \"Donald Trump is prone to making comments that are vey inflammatory from a racial and ethnic perspective,\" Preston told Press TV on Tuesday. \"This reflects the wider divisions in our society,\" he added. \"We have a very polarized society.\" PressTV-'We're sick of Trump's racist slurs': Sen. Warren Senator Warren launches a fundraising campaign to fight Trump's racist policies. Trump made a remark on Monday some called racist at a White House event honoring Native American World War II veterans by referring to Senator Elizabeth Warren as \"Pocahontas.\" \"We have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago,\" Trump said. \"They call her Pocahontas. But you know what, I like you.\" Warren, a noted legal scholar who taught at Harvard Law School, denounced Trump for stopping to a \"disgusting low\" by attacking her with a derisive nickname. \"President Trump couldn't even make it through a ceremony to honor these men without throwing in a racial slur,\" Warren told CNN. Trump started accusing Warren of lying about her heritage and called her \"Pocahontas\" at a campaign rally in June, 2016, according to the Washington Post, when Warren was campaigning for Trump's Democratic rival Hilary Clinton. Warren has been accused of using her Native American Heritage to get ahead in her political career, particularly in the 2012 Massachusetts race for senator, according to the Boston Globe. Genealogists have found a document stating that she has a great-great-great-grandmother who is Native American, which would make her 1/32 Cherokee, but they say it would take more research to confirm that finding.

Listen here. NATO nations have agreed to satisfy the US demand to increase defense spending. This is what US President - Donald Trump - said at a press conference in Brussels during the second day of the NATO summit. President Trump reiterated his earlier request for doubling defense spending target, saying that four per cent of gross domestic product was - quote - the right number. Radio Sputnik discussed Trump's calls to NATO allies to increase defense spending to 4 % of GDP with Keith Preston, the chief editor and director of attackthesystem.com.

However, Trump did not threaten to pull US out of NATO, the source adds. In 2014, all NATO member states agreed to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP)on their militaries. But while countries like the UK and the US paid more than they were obliged to, others, such as Belgium and Spain, are still below 1 percent.

At their joint press conference, he spoke in very gracious and complimentary terms about his host, Prime Minister Theresa May which was in stark contrast to what he had stated in an interview with a local news outlet, The Sun owned by his buddy, Rupert Murdoch. He specifically countered the Sun report were he was quoted, that if the UK engages in trade agreements with the EU countries that the US would not be in the trade business with the UK. He is now indicating that of course the US would negotiate trade deals with the UK without limiting it to agree on trade deals with other countries including those in the EU (European Union). The Sun interview, where President voiced criticisms about the Prime Minister's soft Brexit plan, became public on the evening of the 12th of July when President Trump and the First Lady Melania were being hosted by Prime Minister Theresa May and her husband, Phillip, at a black tie dinner with lots of pomp and circumstance at the home of Winston Churchill at Blenheim Palace. To say that the president couldn't have committed a worse diplomatic faux pas is not an overstatement. Prime Minister Theresa May and U.S. President Donald Trump attend a joint press conference following their meeting at Chequers. Photo: Jack Taylor/Getty Images.On July 13, 2018, Zachary Basu of Axios penned the following report, \"Highlights from Trump and Theresa May's joint press conference\" (Jonathan Swan of Axios was one of the reporters who asked one of the questions at the US President Trump-UK's Theresa May joint press conference.) Excerpts: \"President Trump, speaking at a joint press conference with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May Friday, dismissed the notion that his repeated criticism of NATO countries will help boost Russian President Vladimir Putin's position ahead of their upcoming meeting in Helsinki on Monday, adding that the U.S. has \"been far tougher on Russia than anybody.\" BABY TRUMP BLIMP Axios' Jonathan Swan emails from Chequers: Trump \"has still not been specific about what he wants to achieve from his meeting with Putin. I asked Trump to tell us the three or four things he wanted to achieve from his meeting with Putin and he just listed topic areas -- 'Ukraine,' 'Syria,' 'non-proliferation,' etc. A senior European official told me that when he tried to get an agenda or even goals for the meeting the White House response was very vague.\" President Trump and PM May's comments: Addressing Russia \"\"That's dishonest reporting ... We have been far tougher on Russia than anybody, than anybody. Look I'm not gonna go down 100 years, but we've been extremely tough on Russia.\" -- President Trump \"Helsinki agenda: Trump, in addition to saying rattling off vague discussion topics, said he will \"absolutely\" bring up the question of election meddling in his conversations with Putin. \"I'm not going in with high expectations, but we may come out with some very surprising things.\" Theresa May said that both she and Trump \"agree that it is important to engage Russia from a position of strength and unity, and that we should continue to deter and counter all efforts to undermine our democracies.\" \"The Prime Minister would agree, \"if we have a good relationship with Russia, and with China, and with other countries, that's a good thing,\" said Trump. \"President Obama failed very badly with Crimea,\" Trump said, dodging questions on how Moscow's occupation of the country affects U.S.-Russia relations. \"I don't think we would've done that if I were president...I'm not bad at doing things...so lets see what happens. But this was an Obama disaster.\" NATO summit Spending requirements: \"The UK is one of a handful of nations... in addition to the U.S. meeting the 2% GDP minimum defense spending commitment,\" Trump said, adding that May was \"right there with me\" on pushing others to increase spending.\" \"I can't overestimate how big the meeting with NATO was,\" Trump continued. \"I mean, they had spirit..I'll tell you what, every single person in that room was gung-ho to get it done, get the money in.\" MERKEL(L)/ TRUMP (R) German Chancellor Angela Merkel: \"I have a great relationship with Angela,\" Trump said, before criticizing her on immigration: \"It's not politically correct, but I'll say it, anyway. I think they better watch themselves because you are changing culture, you are changing a lot of things ... It's a very sad situation. It's very unfortunate.\" Nord Stream II pipeline: To me, it's a tragedy. It's a horrific thing being done ... I believe Germany is going to be getting 50, 60, or even I've heard numbers of 70% of their energy from Russia. (It is 9%.) How can you be working for peace and working from strength when someone has that kind of power over your country?...You've given up all your strength.\" See: Full text: Donald Trump-Theresa May press conference - POLITICO QUEEN ELIZABETH II For the rest of the afternoon on the 13th of July 2018, President Trump and the First Lady will be enjoying the afternoon tea with Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle where they will receive the royal treatment.

But now that I know about the DOJ's indictments issued today against specific Russian operators working for the GRU (like US CIA) takes away the president's ability to live in denial regarding Russia' involvement in US elections. This was done just in time for President Trump's meeting with Russia's President Putin. This solid proof neuters President Trump's ability to give away anything to Putin in the upcoming summit.

I guess one of the few things we do well in the UK - maybe the only thing, thinking about it - is through the BBC - without commercial pressures - report more or less news without opinions.

He basically is asking the American public to take his word for it. OK, Mr. Mueller you are not helping the cause, Trump and Putin are simply going to deny deny deny. And the American public are becoming weary of your allegations. Give us something, anything, a little hope that you have the goods on Trump. Midterm election are coming and we need your help!

You have to read the indictment as there is lots of substance and it is an impressive bit of work. Of course, Mr. Mueller will not reveal more than he needs to, in order to present a convincing case. Hugs, Gronda LikeLike Reply 1EarthUnited says: July 13, 2018 at 11:00 pm Agreed, for leverage as any good negotiator would do, he should hand that indictment to Putin. But knowing full well Putin wouldn't bite, and Trump's not really serious about pressing this issue. I did read the indictment, and it seems to be a repeat of the previous indictment . Lots of charges but no smoking gun. I understand Mueller is still building a case, and this is just a bone to throw at the Russian meeting, something for Putin to chew on. Not that it will make any difference. I look forward to the conclusion of Mueller's case, and hopefully will lead to the impeachment of the notorious Orange One!

For all we know, President Trump could be setting up the US for Russia to interfere in US elections again in Nov. 2018, so the democrats do not end up becoming the majority party in the US Congress. The above scenario is just conjecture, but the point is, that we cannot take the chance that he will betray the interests of the USA because he is somehow beholden to President Putin.

July 2018 The Pied Piper of the White House By: perry Published July 26, 2018, in Featured, Opinion, PerryScope PerryScope By Perry Diaz Is the Pied Piper of the White House leading the Republicans to defeat in the 2018 elections? In 1284, as the legend goes, the people of Hamelin, Germany, hired the town's rat-catcher, a piper, to lure the rats away with his magic pipe. The piper was dressed in multi-colored (\"pied\") clothing; hence he was called the \"Pied Piper.\" He led the rats out of the town and into the sea where they drowned. When the town's people refused to pay him for his services, he retaliated by using his magic pipe and led their children away as he had with the rats. Today, the term \"Pied Piper\" describes a person who talks often convincingly but who leads people into disaster. It is also used to identify a leader whom people willingly follow as he leads them into danger or trouble by means of lies and false promises. During the 2016 presidential elections in the U.S., Democratic Party officials labeled the Republican Party's candidate Donald Trump a \"Pied Piper candidate.\" Using his strong appeal to white nationalists and right-wing conservatives, Trump got the nomination of the Republican Party by eliminating his 16 rivals, one by one, in the primaries. During the general election, Trump used demagoguery to deliver a populist message such as \"America First\" and \"Make America great again!\" He also manifested anti-women, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim behavior. But to his die-hard supporters, his coded messages stirred their own prejudices. Massive protests Anti-Trump women's march in Washington, DC. The day after Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2017, the largest organized protest against him occurred in Washington, DC. The protest -- Women's March -- was then the largest single-day protest in U.S. history. Protests in various cities around the world were held in support of the Women's March. After that, more protests occurred against Trump's immigration policy, Travel ban, and the controversial Zero Tolerance Policy that forcibly separated migrant children from their families. As the anti-Trump protests snowballed, his base of diehard voters became angrier. They turned out in large numbers in rallies Trump organized in cities where his voter base was strong. And in these campaign-like rallies, Trump would excite them using inflammatory rhetoric against the anti-Trump protestors. He strongly believes that his followers would follow him blindly and remain loyal to him regardless of what he does - right or wrong. Indeed, on January 23, 2016, then presidential candidate Trump caused controversy when he said during a campaign rally in Iowa: \"I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters.\" That's how confident he was. Knowing how effective it was, he had since repeated the same line over and over again. It worked and they loved it! Which makes one wonder if he'd ask them to jump off the bridge, would they do it? Trump would probably say, \"Yes, they'll jump for me.\" Does that manifest over-confidence or is it symptomatic of his imbalanced psyche? Faux pas A 20-foot orange blimp shaped like a baby in a diaper floats above London. When Trump visited the Queen of England last July 13, huge anti-Trump demonstrations were held in London and other cities. An orange blimp shaped like a baby in a diaper floated above London. It was called \"Baby Trump.\" But what is more surprising was the number of anti-Trump protesters who showed up at the rally. It was estimated that the protesters numbered from 100,000 to 200,000. The British media was particularly critical. One newspaper, the Daily News, showed a cartoon of Trump holding Putin with one hand and shooting Uncle Sam with the other hand. It was captioned, \"OPEN TREASON.\" Trump rudely walks in front of Queen Elizabeth as they they review the honor guard. The social media was also inundated with postings expressing indignation and outrage over Trump's behavior in London and during the NATO Summit in Brussels two days before. Trump broke protocol when he arrived 12 minutes late to his meeting with Queen Elizabeth. And when they reviewed the honor guard, Trump rudely walked in front of her. The Queen had to walk fast to catch up with Trump and walked by his side, which was the norm. After his visit with the Queen at the Windsor Palace, he bragged to reporters that it was the first time in 70 years that the Queen reviewed an honor guard. Certainly, that was a lie. It's interesting to note that no other members of the Royal Family joined Trump and the Queen for tea. Was it a deliberate snub for Trump who had said, \"Britain is in turmoil\" and defended Foreign Minister Boris Johnson who had resigned over Brexit? It was bad enough that Trump made some faux pas during his visit with the Queen; he also criticized Prime Minister Theresa May. He accused her of wrecking Brexit, warning that \"she may have killed off any chance of a vital US trade deal,\" which is a diplomatic taboo to say. He also told May: \"Boris Johnson is good friend... He would make a great prime minister,\" which certainly rubbed May the wrong way. Helsinki disaster Trump and Putin before they begin their private meeting. But the worst thing happened during the Trump-Putin Summit in Helsinki on July 16. During the question and answer session following their press briefing, Trump was asked about the indictment of 12 officers from Russia's GRU, the equivalent of the CIA. They were indicted in the US for allegedly hacking the Democratic Party's computer servers during the 2016 elections. The investigation that led to the indictment was backed up by US intelligence agencies. But in a stunning rebuke of the US intelligence community, Trump declined to endorse the US government's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections, saying he doesn't \"see any reason why\" Russia would be responsible. Standing next to Putin, he then firmly said in no uncertain terms: \"I have great confidence in my intelligence people. But, I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. He just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would.\" Huh? Did Trump just throw America and the American people under the bus? And when Putin was asked whether he had actively wanted Trump to win the presidency, and if he directed any officials to help ensure Trump would win? Putin's answer to the double question was: \"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he [Trump] talked about bringing the US-Russia relationship back to normal.\" It was a disaster! Putin's puppet Putin holds his puppet Trump. The Helsinki disaster triggered a tsunami in public opinion. Waves of Americans vented their anger and displeasure over Trump's treachery. Many called him a traitor, Putin's puppet. How can their Commander-in-Chief sell out to the country's geopolitical enemy? Trump was shocked at the reception back home. Although his diehard base remained loyal by deluging social media with postings of their support, the rest of the country was thunderstruck! Why? He believed that he had just finished an outstanding performance on world stage. He must have felt that America had disgraced him. How can the American people elect him as president and then abandon him when he needed their unqualified support? Now Trump is going to exact vengeance against America for turning her back on him. And what a better way to avenged America's shabby treatment than to find an ally in Putin? So, a few days after his devastating diplomatic fiasco, Trump invited Putin to come to America. He will honor him as his special guest during the military parade he had planned for November 10 to celebrate Veterans Day, which is preceded by the midterm elections on November 6. The outcome of the midterms could lead to Trump taking his victory lap - if he retains majority in Congress -- with Putin on his side, or receive the biggest insult -- if he loses Congress -- to his presidency in front of the hundreds of parading soldiers. Pied Piper of the White House leads America's migrant children away. (Credit: Daryl Cagle illustration / caglecartoons.com) And just like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, the Pied Piper of the White House is going to retaliate with his magical tweets by leading America's migrant children away and propel America into Russia's orbit. (PerryDiaz@gmail.com) A spy or a patriot? By: perry Published July 19, 2018, in Featured, Opinion, PerryScope PerryScope By Perry Diaz Photo op of the leaders of NATO at their annual summit in Brussels. The photo shows the leaders looking up to the left while President Donald Trump is looking up to the opposite side. Makes one wonder what Trump sees that the others don't see? Once the undisputed leader of the free world since the end of World War II, the United States, led the fight against Communism. American presidents took their jobs and responsibilities seriously in seeing to it that red lines were drawn to deter the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) from expanding. This came to be known as \"containment.\" In 1946, the diplomat George Kennan explained this \"containment\" policy: \"The Soviet Union was a political force committed fanatically to the belief that with the U.S. there can be no permanent modus vivendi.\" The following year, President Harry Truman asked Congress to adopt a policy \"The US should give support to countries or peoples threatened by Soviet forces or communist insurrection.\" This principle came to be known as the \"Truman Doctrine.\" This was the beginning of the Cold War. Trump blasts NATO Trump accuses NATO leaders of being delinquent in their defense spending and insisted they double it to 4% of their GDP. Last July 11-12, NATO's cohesiveness was put to test when President Donald Trump attended the annual NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium. On his first day, Trump and several of his aides had breakfast with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. The event, which was televised, began with Trump criticizing German Chancellor Angela Merkel (who was not present) and complained about a gas pipeline linking Russia to Germany, which the German government had approved. He then accused Germany of being \"a captive of Russia.\" When the NATO leaders began their summit meeting, Trump accused them of being delinquent in their defense spending and insisted they double it to 4% of their GDP. However, the 28 other leaders ignored Trump's proposed increased military spending and instead agreed to a joint summit declaration that recommitted them to moving toward the 2% target by 2024, which they already had agreed upon during the 2014 summit. But Trump countered by tweeting that he had \"single-handedly raised vast amounts of money\" for NATO. Evidently, he lied again. President Trump breaks royal protocol, walks in front of Queen Elizabeth II when they were reviewing the honor guard. He also keeps Queen Elizabeth waiting for 12 minutes when Trump arrives late at the Windsor Palace. On July 13, Trump visited the Queen of England and met with UK Prime Minister Theresa May. It was a pretty hectic week but it could have generated a lot of goodwill among the leaders of NATO and strengthened America's enduring military partnership with her 28 NATO allies. Instead, Trump wreaked havoc on the alliance. Foolish, stupid Trump and Putin enter the press room. Putin was noticeably observed walking with his signature KGB stance. But not only did Trump blast his NATO allies, he blamed his own country for the deterioration of relations with Russia. Before the Helsinki summit began, Trump tweeted: \"Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!\" The Russian foreign ministry tweeted back: \"We agree.\" On July 16, Trump and Putin met in Helsinki, Finland, behind closed doors with just their interpreters. Their meeting lasted more than two hours. When they finally emerged in the pressroom, Putin was noticeably observed walking with his signature KGB stance. Putin took charge of the briefing by speaking first. His report did not reveal anything that showed what they had agreed upon in specific, measurable, and deliverable terms. They're all nice things to hear if you happen to be in Alice's Wonderland. But in geopolitical terms, it's all hogwash. Chilling shock waves President Vladimir Putin, right, and Main Intelligence Agency Chief Valentin Korabelnikov, center background, look at a model of the Defense Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate in Moscow, Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2006. During the question and answer session, Trump was asked about the indictment of 12 officers from Russia's GRU, the equivalent of the CIA. Indicted for allegedly hacking the Democratic Party's computer servers during the 2016 elections, Special Counsel Robert Mueller III issued a 29-page indictment on July 13, 2018 against the Russian spies. The investigation that led to the indictment was backed up by US intelligence agencies' detailed narrative, which was provided to Trump before the summit. But in a surprising - and stunning - rebuke of the US intelligence community, Trump declined to endorse the US government's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections, saying he doesn't \"see any reason why\" Russia would be responsible. Standing next to Putin, he then firmly said in no uncertain terms: \"I have great confidence in my intelligence people. But, I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. He just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would.\" Evidently, Trump just vindicated Putin of interfering in the US elections, which sent chilling shock waves around the world. Trump had just thrown America and the American people under the bus. Trump vindicates Putin of interfering in the US elections, which sent chilling shock waves around the world. Trump has just thrown America and the American people under the bus. (Cartoon credit: South China Morning Post). When Putin was asked whether he had actively wanted Trump to win the presidency, and if he directed any officials to help ensure Trump would win? Putin may have let the cat out of the bag without knowing the repercussion. His answer to the double question was: \"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he [Trump] talked about bringing the US-Russia relationship back to normal.\" The following day, as criticisms of Trump's performance snowballed upon his return to Washington, he hastily gathered reporters at the White House. He professed his full faith in the U.S. intelligence agencies. But in a play of words, Trump used the \"Would/Wouldn't\" word game, apparently in a desperate attempt to control the geopolitical tsunami he created in Helsinki. He then read a prepared script by his staff, \"In a key sentence in my remarks, I said 'would' instead of 'wouldn't.' The sentence should have been, 'I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia.' I think that probably clarifies it,\" he said. Then he added, extemporaneously (unscripted): \"It could be other people also. There are a lot of people out there. There was no collusion at all,\" in an apparent attempt to shield Putin and the indicted Russian spies. That blew it! Pax Russica Daily Mirror brands Trump a traitor. In defense of Putin, former Republican presidential candidate and commentator Patrick Buchanan posted on his website: \"Trump's message has been clear, consistent and startling. NATO is obsolete. European allies have freeloaded off U.S. defense while rolling up huge trade surpluses at our expense. Those days are over. Europeans are going to stop stealing our markets and start paying for their own defense. And there will be no Cold War II.\" This brings to the fore how Putin reacted at the end of Cold War I. In his annual state of the nation address to the Russian parliament and the country's top political leaders in April 2005, Putin said the Soviet collapse was a tragedy for Russians. \"First and foremost it is worth acknowledging that the demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,\" Putin said. \"As for the Russian people, it became a genuine tragedy. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens and countrymen found themselves beyond the fringes of Russian territory.\" In retrospect, it is a well-known fact that Reagan was instrumental in the dissolution of the Soviet Empire in 1989 when he worked with USSR's Secretary General Mikhail Gorbachev under the principle of \"detante,\" a period of easing of the geopolitical tensions between the US and USSR, which led to lessening the Cold War. But detante worked favorably for Reagan because his goal - unbeknown to Gorbachev -- was to achieve the end of communism in Eastern Europe, the break up of the Warsaw Pact, and, eventually, the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In Putin's playbook, he'd use Trump to achieve the break up of the European Union (EU) and the dissolution of NATO (23 of the 28 members of EU are members of NATO), the same way Reagan used Gorbachev to break up of the Warsaw Pact and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yes, Trump and Buchanan were right; there will be no more Cold War II, not because America and Russia would become partners and the two world superpowers. It's because America would cease to be the world's sole superpower, and EU and NATO would no longer exist. The Russian Federation would then fill the power vacuum left by the US and become the only superpower. It would be the birth of a new Russian Empire that would include all the former Soviet satellites that had joined the defunct NATO. It would be a complete turnaround of the East-West geopolitical relationship. Hence, we'll see the end of Pax Americana and the beginning of Pax Russica. Spies among us Maria Butina, a Russian national residing in the US, is arrested and indicted on charges of conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent. Just about the time Trump and Putin were answering questions from reporters at the conclusion of their private meeting, a Russian national residing in the US, Maria Butina, was arrested and indicted on charges of conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent. Putin's background as a KGB officer assigned in East Germany before the implosion of the Soviet Empire could most probably been involved in recruiting spies - known as \"assets\" -- to work for Russia. East Germany was then a hotbed of espionage activities because of its proximity to NATO countries. Would it be outrageous then to suspect that Trump could be Putin's asset? Siberian candidate. In my column, \"Was Trump the Siberian Candidate?\" (December 28, 2016), I wrote: \"During the presidential campaign, the American media had suggested that Trump was the 'Siberian Candidate' whom Putin helped in winning the presidency by orchestrating the hacking of the U.S. elections. While Trump seemed to be Putin's man in the U.S. elections, it's turning out now that Trump may have deceived - or tricked -- Putin all along to help him win the election. And this begs the question: Was Trump the 'Siberian Candidate' or an American patriot?\" A wise man once said, \"When in doubt, there is no doubt.\" (PerryDiaz@gmail.com) Trump's xenophobic paranoia of immigrants By: perry Published July 12, 2018, in Featured, Opinion, PerryScope PerryScope By Perry Diaz Protestors march as they demand an end to the mass incarceration and criminalization of immigrant families. Ever since President Donald Trump began his presidency on January 20, 2017, he has demonstrated and manifested negative views of immigrants, whether legal or illegal. It seems that he doesn't welcome the arrival of immigrants particularly those of color. Last January 2018, when lawmakers presented Trump the idea of restoring protections for immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations as part of a bipartisan immigration bill, he reportedly replied: \"Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?\" He then suggested that the U.S. should admit more immigrants from places like Norway, an inherent preference for immigrants from Europe. In trying to defend Trump's use of the term \"shithole,\" the White House issued a statement saying: \"Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people.\" But Mr. President, you seem to forget that immigrants are Americans, too. They also pay taxes and serve in the military, don't they? Recently, news reports reveal that the U.S. Army is abruptly - and quietly -- discharging immigrant recruits. Some recruits were told that, \"They were considered security risks because they have relatives abroad or because the Defense Department had not completed background checks on them.\" Again, this is another case of xenophobic paranoia of immigrants that Trump had manifested since he took office. Travel ban Anti-Muslim Ban protest march. Indeed, how can one forget that in just a few days after he was sworn in as president, he issued an executive order (EO) banning Muslims from certain countries from entering the U.S? The courts ruled the EO unconstitutional but Trump rewrote it as \"travel ban\" to make it more palatable to Federal judges. After seesawing through the lower and appellate courts, the EO eventually reached the Supreme Court where the conservative majority upheld Trump's travel ban on people coming from seven countries, five of which are predominantly Muslim countries. The other two are North Korea and Venezuela. Surmise it to say, these two countries were included in the \"travel ban\" to avoid the EO from being branded as \"anti-Muslim,\" which it is. Children in a chain-link cage inside a warehouse in South Texas. \"These are animals\" During a Cabinet meeting attended by news reporters, Trump vented his anger on the nation's immigration laws. He called them, \"The dumbest laws on immigration in the world.\" \"We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in -- we're stopping a lot of them,\" Trump said. \"You wouldn't believe how bad these people are. These aren't people, these are animals, and we're taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that's never happened before.\" Calling certain people \"animals\" bespeaks Trump's insensitivity and callousness of character. It manifests his low esteem and lack of respect for immigrants. The fact that he ordered migrant children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border to be placed like animals in chain-link cages inside windowless warehouses denotes his total disregard for human rights. And in another expression of his hatred for immigrants, Trump tweeted: \"We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order.\" Clearly, the fact that he wants to deport undocumented immigrants without \"due process\" is not only unconstitutional, it smacks of dictatorial tendency. Fake Pocahontas Sen. Elizabeth Warren and President Donald Trump. When Sen. Elizabeth Warren visited a processing center for undocumented immigrants on the Texas border, she dismissed the notion that the migrants should be denied due process. \"A mother with a young child who faced threats from gangs and asks for asylum in the U.S. should not be rejected without a hearing,\" she said. \"That's not what our country stands for, we do have a system of laws,\" she added. Miffed by Warren's constant criticism of his immigration policies, Trump, at a recent campaign rally in Montana, repeated his mockery of Warren, calling her \"the fake Pocahontas.\" He told the crowd that should the two find themselves on a debate stage, he would challenge her to submit to genetic testing to prove that she has Native American ancestors (Warren, who is leading potential 2020 presidential rival, has said she stands by stories about her Native American ancestors she was told as a child.) Warren shot back: \"While you obsess over my genes, your Admin is conducting DNA tests on little kids because you ripped them from their mamas,\" she wrote on Twitter, a reference to the migrant children who have been separated from their parents because of Trump's \"Zero Tolerance Policy.\" El Presidente Pocotonto Friedrich Trump and family. But his derision of Warren boomeranged when, according to FaceBook blogger Bobby M. Reyes, many Filipino-and-Hispanic voters call Trump, \"El Presidente Pocotonto.\" Reyes said, \"Is there truth to the rumor that Hispanic folks and Filipinos now call President Trump the 'Pocotonto' after his 'Pocahontas' comment? To those who don't understand Spanish or Filipino, 'Poco' means in Spanish 'a little bit' and 'Tonto' is the word in both languages for a 'fool.' Is President Trump losing his marbles, as many of his critics claim?\" But some Latino immigrants would call him, \"Locotonto,\" that is, \"crazy fool.\" For someone who has exhibited abhorrence for immigrants, Trump needs to remind himself of his own provenance. His grandfather, Friedrich Trump, immigrated to the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor in 1885. But had his grandson Donald Trump been the president then, Donald's \"Zero Tolerance Policy\" would have barred Friedrich from entering the U.S. After living in America for many years, the Trump family patriarch attempted to move his family back to Bavaria but was denied entry to the country. In a letter to Prince Regent Leopold published by Harper's Magazine, Friedrich Trump slammed being denied access to his former country. \"Why should we be deported? This is very, very hard for a family. What will our fellow citizens think if honest subjects are faced with such a decree--not to mention the great material losses it would incur,\" he wrote. [Source: Newsweek, 6-27-18] Immigrant family ties Trump's wives: Ivana Trump (left), Melania Trump (middle), and Marla Maples (right). It is also important to note that Trump has been married twice to Eastern European immigrants: his first wife Ivana Trump and his third and current wife Melania Trump. His second wife was Marla Maples. She was born in the U.S. Ivana Trump was born Ivana Marie Zelnickova in Czechoslovakia. She moved to Canada in 1972. In 1976, she moved to New York City to promote the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. It was in New York City where she met and married Donald Trump in 1977. Ivana became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1988. [Source: Wikipedia] Melania Trump was born Melanija Knavs (Germanized to Melania Knauss) in the Yugoslav republic of Slovenia. She worked as a fashion model in Milan and Paris. She moved to New York City in 1996. In 2001, she became U.S. permanent resident. She married Donald Trump in 2005 and got her citizenship in 2006. [Ibid] Has Trump lost his marbles? With Trump's immigrant family ties and two marriages to immigrants, one wonders why he is so xenophobic and patently paranoid of people immigrating to America, which begs the question: Is Trump racist? Furthermore, was there an incident or experience in his childhood that alienated him from people who were born in countries other than America? Is he suffering from misopedia (hatred of children), which could be the reason for his cruel, despicable, and inhumane treatment of migrant children? At the end of the day, one might ask: Is Locotonto truly losing his marbles as some of his critics claim? Or is he just a bumbling fool swinging a wrecking ball at the multi-cultural tapestry of America? (PerryDiaz@gmail.com) Quo vadis, Sereno? By: perry Published July 5, 2018, in Featured, Opinion, PerryScope, Politics & Government PerryScope By Perry Diaz Rodrigo Duterte and Ma. Lourdes Sereno. Unceremo-niously ousted as Chief Justice by an eight-vote majority of the Supreme Court, Maria Lourdes Sereno must be contemplating what her future will be? During a press conference in the aftermath of the controversial \"quo warranto\" petition that passed muster of the Supreme Court, Sereno told reporters at a press briefing that she \"believes she does not have to hold her old title to continue her fight against President Rodrigo Duterte's policies, which she said have taken a toll on the poor and marginalized.\" It was her opening salvo in her war against the forces led by Duterte who conspired to remove her from the High Court. Speaking in the vernacular, Sereno said: \"Many people are going hungry and many are getting killed.\" It was the perfect message to wage a campaign against the incumbent president. Sereno ousted: Those who voted for her and those who voted against her. Sereno's departure from the Supreme Court opens new doors for her, which is certainly a welcome opportunity to advocate reforms in the country's judicial system. And there is no better venue than to serve in the Senate where she could use it as a platform to effect changes in the dysfunctional Judiciary. The opportunity to do so came from Liberal Party (LP) President Sen. Francis Pangilinan who offered her a spot on the LP's senatorial slate in next year's midterm elections. Pangilinan said Sereno would be a strong addition to the opposition. \"We need strong women in our ticket,\" Pangilinan said. Indeed, Sereno, who has never held an elective office before, would add to the opposition line-up her broad legal and judicial experience, which is sorely lacking in today's electoral process where candidates for office are usually drawn from the entertainment sector. In essence, the qualification that is being used in selecting candidates is \"popularity,\" which of course translates to the ability of candidates to get votes and win elections. Gone are the days when candidates were some of the best legal minds in the country, the likes of which include Jose P. Laurel, Claro M. Recto, Quentin Paredes, Jose Diokno, Emmanuel Pelaez, and Camilo Osias. Although Osias was not a lawyer - he was an educator - he was an eloquent orator whose persistent advocacy paid off in 1932 with the passage of the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act, which put the Philippines on the road to independence in 1946. Today, actors, comedians, TV personalities, basketball players, and boxers dominate the political process. Conflicting laws Pro-Sereno rally: \"Quo warranto ibasura\" (Junk quo warranto). It is no wonder then that there are a lot of conflicting laws that contravene each other, thus sowing confusion in the interpretation of the law. Take for example the ouster of Sereno. The Constitution is very clear as to how Supreme Court justices are removed from office, which is by impeachment. When the impeachment case against Sereno stalled in the House of Representatives, the Duterte administration resorted to using a quo warranto petition. But quo warranto has never been used before in lieu of impeachment. Nevertheless, eight of the Supreme Court justices, comprising the majority, voted in favor of the quo warranto petition. But who is there to challenge the validity of quo warranto among members of the High Court? In essence, the use of quo warranto to remove Sereno can be best described as \"judicial voodoo.\" Judicial voodoo Pro-Sereno rally: \"Defend the Rule of Law.\" In the Supreme Court ruling that absolved Justice Mariano del Castillo of plagiarism, \"Judicial Voodoo vs. Rule of Law\" (November 2, 2010), I wrote: \"The Supreme Court ruling defied conventional logic and used convoluted rationale that could only be construed as an aberration - or abrogation - of established norms and standards. It was classic case of 'Judicial voodoo' taking precedence over the rule of law where the magistrates used mumbo-jumbo reasoning [to arrive at a decision].\" \"Another controversial ruling of the Supreme Court was when it totally ignored Section 15 Article VII of the Constitution -- which bans midnight appointments - and allowed then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to appoint Justice Renato Corona as Chief Justice during the prohibited period. This could only be construed as 'judicial voodoo' where rule of law was debased for the purpose of circumventing the constitution for the aggrandizement of a few.\" [Ibid] \"Sad to say, with Corona at the helm of the Supreme Court until 2018 [Note: Corona was impeached on December 12, 2011] -- when he reaches mandatory age retirement -- and the other Arroyo appointees holding a majority until then, the Aquino administration would be under the spell of 'judicial voodooism' for a long time to come. Are these the signs that portend to the coming of the Dark Age in Philippine jurisprudence? Or, are we already at that age?\" [Ibid] In the case of the Supreme Court's ruling on the quo warranto petition, the majority disregarded the constitutional provision on impeaching constitutional officers and blindly used convoluted reasoning to judicially lynch Sereno. The sad part is that there was no higher authority that could override the Supreme Court justices' lack of judicial aptitude in interpreting the Constitution. Solicitor General Jose Calida: Did he do a hatchet job for Duterte? The quo warranto petition against Sereno was filed before the Supreme Court by Solicitor General Jose Calida to remove her from her post as the Supreme Court Chief Justice. The petition was made to nullify then President Benigno Aquino III's appointment of Sereno as Chief Justice of the High Court. The legal community, including the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) and a battery of law deans and professors, reportedly denounced Calida's petition as \"unconstitutional.\" Many legal luminaries are of the opinion that allowing Sereno to be ousted via quo warranto not only violated the constitutional provision on impeachable officials and the rule of court, but it would also make justices of the High Court, and the entire Judiciary, vulnerable to undue pressure and intimidation from the President, who is the appointing authority on all judicial appointments, from Municipal Judges to Supreme Court Justices. Sereno's options What are Sereno's four options? With Sereno out of government service, she is faced with four viable options, viz: (1) Retire and write her memoirs; (2) Go back to the practice of law; (3) Form or join a public interest group to advocate for judicial reform; or (4) Run for office. Under Option 1, Sereno retires and devotes her time to writing her memoirs, which would tell her story and expose the inequity she suffered from the Executive Branch. But at 58 years of age, she's too young to go into retirement. Under Option 2, Sereno goes back to the practice of law, which would be financially rewarding for her. Under Option 3, Sereno forms or joins a public interest group to advocate for judicial reform and to overhaul or streamline the Judiciary Branch to make it more effective and responsive to the public's needs. Under Option 4, Sereno runs for Senator, which would give her the opportunity to pursue her advocacies at the highest legislative level in government. Winning a Senate seat would effectively vindicate her of the accusations made against her, which led to her ouster from the High Court. Indeed, the possibility of Sereno running for a Senate seat next year is one of the best news since Duterte became president. Sereno would bring a lot of experience to the Legislative Branch. Since there are only a few lawmakers who actually know the law, Sereno's entry into the political arena would be an opportune time for her to serve the public's interests and make a great deal of difference. When asked if she's going to run for office, Sereno said she has yet to discuss the matter with her team because she wants to focus on her legal and political problems for now. But she should make up her mind soon because there is barely a year left to the 2019 elections. She should position herself at the head of the pack of senatoriables. The sooner, the better. She should also be cognizant that politics is a game where latecomers rarely make it to the finish line. Indeed, she has only one chance to win a Senate seat. If she misses that chance, it's good-bye for her. So, quo vadis, Sereno?

By Terry H. Schwadron, DCReport New York Editor It was as if Trump was throwing one of his political rallies in Europe, insulting his NATO hosts, but tossing some more political red meat to his base voters back home. It came complete with overstatement, big personality, a demand for praise and a lot of misstatement. We know that Trump's natural political feelings are awfully distasteful and undiplomatic toward leaders who are supposed to be the friendliest. His poorly thought-out blurting out of anti-German, anti-NATO, anti-Europe remarks at the outset of a NATO diplomatic meeting yesterday was at once embarrassing to all but Trump, ineffective and just plain discourteous. It was left to Mike Pompeo, secretary of state, to try to paper over the deepening transatlantic rift with tweets and visits with counterparts. In Washington, meanwhile, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to approve a non-binding resolution reminding all that NATO countries remain our longest-lasting and important allies. Wow, even Senate Republicans were willing to say no to Trump's posture. In fact, the other leaders were going out of their way not to provoke Trump, but clearly were upset that Trump has emerged as a strong threat to the continuing alliance. What must Russian leader Vladimir Putin think - it has been his dream for two decades or more to drive a wedge between NATO countries and the U.S. Trump told the NATO head that Germany was in Russia's pocket because Germany has a natural gas deal with Russia \"worth billions.\" As I have argued, I just cannot quite understand why Trump is picking a fight with several allies for not spending enough on defense - all in the name of supporting NATO, the treaty organization that all have rallied around. At issue is Trump's complaint that other nations are not spending 2% of GDP, or gross domestic product, on their own defense, apparently concluding that the U.S. is left paying for their failures to pony up. In advance of a NATO meeting, Trump sent nasty notes to his fellow NATO allies to tell them they are shirkers and threatening to reconsider keeping U.S. troops in Europe. He picked up on the theme as he arrived in their midst. In fact, that's not how NATO gets its money. NATO has a budget to cover common civilian and military costs, as The New York Times explained last year, and some NATO-owned assets are also commonly funded when they are used in operations. The U.S. pays 22% of those costs, according to a formula based on national income. None of the NATO allies owe on these contributions. Instead, Trump is referring imprecisely to a goal NATO has set for each member to spend at least 2% of its GDP on its own defense each year. Only five of the 28 members meet that goal-the U.S., Greece, Britain, Estonia and Poland. In fact, the 2% guideline--not a legally binding requirement--came about in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea and invaded parts of Ukraine, and even then identified it as a goal for 2024. Why is 2% even the right level of defense spending for a nation? Americans spend more than 54% of the federal budget on defense or about 3.5% of GDP. In fact, the day ended with Trump calling for the allies each to double proposed defense spending to 4%. Trump's new round of insults represents an impolite poke at the European allies. \"The letters, sent in June, are the latest sign of acrimony between Trump and American allies... Trump has repeatedly questioned its value and has claimed that its members are taking advantage of the United States,\" said The Times. What makes all this curious, of course, is that it comes amid a budding tariff war that seems to be punishing allies (and U.S. consumers) and a summit with Putin. What makes it weird is why now? You would think that in pursuit of America First, the president would want to show off a Big Stick wherever he can - which he is doing in general - but in response to some problem. What problem exactly are we trying to fix? If Trump truly believes that U.S. troops are deployed incorrectly, why is he insisting on an attack on allies over their defense spending rather than getting the Pentagon to come up with a better deployment plan? After all, there are real international problems going on for which some actual cooperation would be helpful. Refugees continue to stream from war zones in Syria, people are starving in Yemen, there are nuclear weapons issues in North Korea and Iran and, yes, the Russians are acting out in election interference as well as in expansionist policies. Instead, the president is focused on an incorrect assumption that seems to attract like some kind of shiny object. That he does so without providing an overview of U.S. military and diplomatic strategic goals, an assessment of our needs and costs and a thoughtful review, if warranted, of our commitments to allies, is more than discomforting. Indeed, why do we need to be spending as much as we do on American military efforts if we are working at the same time to withdraw? It no longer is such a longshot thought, for example, that Trump will agree to draw down U.S. troop presence in Korea or even from Europe. I don't understand our commitment in Afghanistan, in Korea, in the Middle East or, increasingly, in secret deployments across Africa - and from what I read, apparently, neither does Congress. What we all can see is more respect and reliance on strongmen around the world, who each want to control regional affairs in ways that will reduce American influence, values and, eventually, prosperity. Isolation is not a global policy. It is a retreat. If that is the Trump goal, let's deal with that and have the appropriate debates in Congress and in public. Let's knock off fake concerns about whether Germany ponies up more money for its own defense to meet an arbitrary goal.

Because the latest from their Editorial Board - which \"represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher,\" is entitled:Trump Got From NATO Everything Obama Ever Asked ForIt begins: Now that the smoke has cleared from the NATO summit meeting, the most tangible result is apparent: President Trump advanced President Barack Obama's initiative to keep the allies on track to shoulder a more equitable share of NATO's costs. Mr. Trump even signed on to a tough statement directed at Russia. For once he saw eye to eye with his predecessor. -New York TimesTo be sure, the Times dings Trump for bruising a few EU egos (while making his Chief of Staff John Kelly cringe during a particularly blunt public excoriation of Germany), and they rebuke the President for suggesting the US might withdraw from NATO if military spending targets aren't met by member nations. At the end of the day, however, the New York Times just gave President Trump massive credit for achieving significant progress on a longstanding dispute over fairness and commitments. - READ MORE [divider][/divider]NATO's secretary general agreed on Wednesday that President Trump's call for other members to boost their defense spending under the military alliance is having an effect, and promised that other NATO members would soon be chipping in more. Trump was in Belgium Wednesday to keep up his complaint that other NATO members are \"not paying what they should,\" and said it's an \"unfair burden\" to the U.S.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg agreed.\"We all agree that we have to do more,\" he said in a joint appearance with Trump. \"I agree with you that we have to do make sure that our allies are investing more. And last year was the biggest increase in defense spending across Europe and Canada in that generation.\"\"Why was that last year?\" Trump asked.\"It's also because of your leadership, because of your carried message,\" Stoltenberg said.\"They won't write that, but that's OK,\" Trump replied, referring to members of the press.\"No, I have said it before, but the thing is that it really has,\" Stoltenberg said. \"And your message is having an impact, and we are going to build on that to make sure that we have further increases.\" - READ MOREHelp Support True Pundit's Independent Voice by Contributing Today! $ Donation Amount: We can only deliver independent news & Intel with your support.

A spy or a patriot? July 19, 2018 | Featured, Opinion, PerryScope PerryScope By Perry Diaz Photo op of the leaders of NATO at their annual summit in Brussels. The photo shows the leaders looking up to the left while President Donald Trump is looking up to the opposite side. Makes one wonder what Trump sees that the others don't see? Once the undisputed leader of the free world since the end of World War II, the United States, led the fight against Communism. American presidents took their jobs and responsibilities seriously in seeing to it that red lines were drawn to deter the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) from expanding. This came to be known as \"containment.\" In 1946, the diplomat George Kennan explained this \"containment\" policy: \"The Soviet Union was a political force committed fanatically to the belief that with the U.S. there can be no permanent modus vivendi.\" The following year, President Harry Truman asked Congress to adopt a policy \"The US should give support to countries or peoples threatened by Soviet forces or communist insurrection.\" This principle came to be known as the \"Truman Doctrine.\" This was the beginning of the Cold War. Trump blasts NATO Trump accuses NATO leaders of being delinquent in their defense spending and insisted they double it to 4% of their GDP. Last July 11-12, NATO's cohesiveness was put to test when President Donald Trump attended the annual NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium. On his first day, Trump and several of his aides had breakfast with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. The event, which was televised, began with Trump criticizing German Chancellor Angela Merkel (who was not present) and complained about a gas pipeline linking Russia to Germany, which the German government had approved. He then accused Germany of being \"a captive of Russia.\" When the NATO leaders began their summit meeting, Trump accused them of being delinquent in their defense spending and insisted they double it to 4% of their GDP. However, the 28 other leaders ignored Trump's proposed increased military spending and instead agreed to a joint summit declaration that recommitted them to moving toward the 2% target by 2024, which they already had agreed upon during the 2014 summit. But Trump countered by tweeting that he had \"single-handedly raised vast amounts of money\" for NATO. Evidently, he lied again. President Trump breaks royal protocol, walks in front of Queen Elizabeth II when they were reviewing the honor guard. He also keeps Queen Elizabeth waiting for 12 minutes when Trump arrives late at the Windsor Palace. On July 13, Trump visited the Queen of England and met with UK Prime Minister Theresa May. It was a pretty hectic week but it could have generated a lot of goodwill among the leaders of NATO and strengthened America's enduring military partnership with her 28 NATO allies. Instead, Trump wreaked havoc on the alliance. Foolish, stupid Trump and Putin enter the press room. Putin was noticeably observed walking with his signature KGB stance. But not only did Trump blast his NATO allies, he blamed his own country for the deterioration of relations with Russia. Before the Helsinki summit began, Trump tweeted: \"Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!\" The Russian foreign ministry tweeted back: \"We agree.\" On July 16, Trump and Putin met in Helsinki, Finland, behind closed doors with just their interpreters. Their meeting lasted more than two hours. When they finally emerged in the pressroom, Putin was noticeably observed walking with his signature KGB stance. Putin took charge of the briefing by speaking first. His report did not reveal anything that showed what they had agreed upon in specific, measurable, and deliverable terms. They're all nice things to hear if you happen to be in Alice's Wonderland. But in geopolitical terms, it's all hogwash. Chilling shock waves President Vladimir Putin, right, and Main Intelligence Agency Chief Valentin Korabelnikov, center background, look at a model of the Defense Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate in Moscow, Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2006. During the question and answer session, Trump was asked about the indictment of 12 officers from Russia's GRU, the equivalent of the CIA. Indicted for allegedly hacking the Democratic Party's computer servers during the 2016 elections, Special Counsel Robert Mueller III issued a 29-page indictment on July 13, 2018 against the Russian spies. The investigation that led to the indictment was backed up by US intelligence agencies' detailed narrative, which was provided to Trump before the summit. But in a surprising - and stunning - rebuke of the US intelligence community, Trump declined to endorse the US government's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections, saying he doesn't \"see any reason why\" Russia would be responsible. Standing next to Putin, he then firmly said in no uncertain terms: \"I have great confidence in my intelligence people. But, I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. He just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would.\" Evidently, Trump just vindicated Putin of interfering in the US elections, which sent chilling shock waves around the world. Trump had just thrown America and the American people under the bus. Trump vindicates Putin of interfering in the US elections, which sent chilling shock waves around the world. Trump has just thrown America and the American people under the bus. (Cartoon credit: South China Morning Post). When Putin was asked whether he had actively wanted Trump to win the presidency, and if he directed any officials to help ensure Trump would win? Putin may have let the cat out of the bag without knowing the repercussion. His answer to the double question was: \"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he [Trump] talked about bringing the US-Russia relationship back to normal.\" The following day, as criticisms of Trump's performance snowballed upon his return to Washington, he hastily gathered reporters at the White House. He professed his full faith in the U.S. intelligence agencies. But in a play of words, Trump used the \"Would/Wouldn't\" word game, apparently in a desperate attempt to control the geopolitical tsunami he created in Helsinki. He then read a prepared script by his staff, \"In a key sentence in my remarks, I said 'would' instead of 'wouldn't.' The sentence should have been, 'I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia.' I think that probably clarifies it,\" he said. Then he added, extemporaneously (unscripted): \"It could be other people also. There are a lot of people out there. There was no collusion at all,\" in an apparent attempt to shield Putin and the indicted Russian spies. That blew it! Pax Russica Daily Mirror brands Trump a traitor. In defense of Putin, former Republican presidential candidate and commentator Patrick Buchanan posted on his website: \"Trump's message has been clear, consistent and startling. NATO is obsolete. European allies have freeloaded off U.S. defense while rolling up huge trade surpluses at our expense. Those days are over. Europeans are going to stop stealing our markets and start paying for their own defense. And there will be no Cold War II.\" This brings to the fore how Putin reacted at the end of Cold War I. In his annual state of the nation address to the Russian parliament and the country's top political leaders in April 2005, Putin said the Soviet collapse was a tragedy for Russians. \"First and foremost it is worth acknowledging that the demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,\" Putin said. \"As for the Russian people, it became a genuine tragedy. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens and countrymen found themselves beyond the fringes of Russian territory.\" In retrospect, it is a well-known fact that Reagan was instrumental in the dissolution of the Soviet Empire in 1989 when he worked with USSR's Secretary General Mikhail Gorbachev under the principle of \"detante,\" a period of easing of the geopolitical tensions between the US and USSR, which led to lessening the Cold War. But detante worked favorably for Reagan because his goal - unbeknown to Gorbachev -- was to achieve the end of communism in Eastern Europe, the break up of the Warsaw Pact, and, eventually, the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In Putin's playbook, he'd use Trump to achieve the break up of the European Union (EU) and the dissolution of NATO (23 of the 28 members of EU are members of NATO), the same way Reagan used Gorbachev to break up of the Warsaw Pact and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yes, Trump and Buchanan were right; there will be no more Cold War II, not because America and Russia would become partners and the two world superpowers. It's because America would cease to be the world's sole superpower, and EU and NATO would no longer exist. The Russian Federation would then fill the power vacuum left by the US and become the only superpower. It would be the birth of a new Russian Empire that would include all the former Soviet satellites that had joined the defunct NATO. It would be a complete turnaround of the East-West geopolitical relationship. Hence, we'll see the end of Pax Americana and the beginning of Pax Russica. Spies among us Maria Butina, a Russian national residing in the US, is arrested and indicted on charges of conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent. Just about the time Trump and Putin were answering questions from reporters at the conclusion of their private meeting, a Russian national residing in the US, Maria Butina, was arrested and indicted on charges of conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent. Putin's background as a KGB officer assigned in East Germany before the implosion of the Soviet Empire could most probably been involved in recruiting spies - known as \"assets\" -- to work for Russia. East Germany was then a hotbed of espionage activities because of its proximity to NATO countries. Would it be outrageous then to suspect that Trump could be Putin's asset? Siberian candidate. In my column, \"Was Trump the Siberian Candidate?\" (December 28, 2016), I wrote: \"During the presidential campaign, the American media had suggested that Trump was the 'Siberian Candidate' whom Putin helped in winning the presidency by orchestrating the hacking of the U.S. elections. While Trump seemed to be Putin's man in the U.S. elections, it's turning out now that Trump may have deceived - or tricked -- Putin all along to help him win the election. And this begs the question: Was Trump the 'Siberian Candidate' or an American patriot?\" A wise man once said, \"When in doubt, there is no doubt.\" (PerryDiaz@gmail.com) Tweet Read More ... \"> 6 comments This entry was tagged with: Cold War, Donald Trump, Espionage, Geopolitics, Helsinki, NATO, Pax Russica, treason, Trump-Putin Summit, Vladimir Putin More like this: Has Chinese colonization begun?

Fernando Habito says: July 20, 2018 at 6:03 am This article documented ...The US elected a man-child with bloated ego,treason,misogynist,racist and stupid Trump show to the world..How to destroy World Alliance DEMOCRACY. Reply perry says: July 22, 2018 at 5:06 pm Hi Fernando, Trump will also destroy America if he remains in power. Perry Reply Jaime says: July 20, 2018 at 1:41 pm China is the real problem for world peace and Trump is addressing that. China stated that it will dominate the world economically and militarily. This goal can only be accomplished if China is allowed to dominate world's trade and make a lot of money to pay for their ambitions. Trump has now taken steps to curtail trade with China to stop the money stream. Trump is cleverly using the imbalance of trade as the cover to what he really wants to accomplish -- stop China's ambitions. Meantime, he is befriending Putin so he does not get in the way of the US curbing China. Reply perry says: July 22, 2018 at 5:05 pm Dear Jaime, China wants to dominate the world. Nothing has changed in its goal since the time of Mao Zedong. Perry Reply Ben Rivera says: July 23, 2018 at 12:35 pm It is very obvious that Perry is nothing but a mouthpiece of the Democrats and inflicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome. On NATO, contrary to Perry's claim, Trump actually strengthened NATO by asking them to increase their defense spending up to 2% of their GDP since about 23 out of 28 countries have not done so. Trump was right to chastise Merkel as a captive of Russia since Germany's energy needs will be 70% coming from Russia once the pipeline is completed. Perry does not mention the fact that Trump has been strong against Russia (more than Obama) with the imposition of tough economic sanctions, expelling 60 Russian diplomats, closing 3 Russian diplomatic facilities, providing arms to Ukraine, killing hundreds of Russian and its mercenaries in Syria, etc. Trump is an American patriot for standing up to Russia and for his excellent handling of the U.S. economy. Reply perry says: July 24, 2018 at 7:49 pm Hi Ben, I am a journalist/columnist/opinion maker. I researched my materials, which means that talking points are important in my analysis of the issue so I can intelligently form my opinion on the issue. No I'm not a mouthpiece of the Democratic Party. On the contrary I've been a registered Republican since 1983. I've been involved in national, state, and local campaigns as a member of the county Republican Party. As an opinion maker though, I have to set aside my own political beliefs and deal with the issue impartially. On the travel ban, as to your statement that I \"asserted that the travel ban which was upheld by the Supreme Court as 'anti-Muslim'when in fact it is not.\" You're wrong,pal. Here is what I wrote in my column: \"Indeed, how can one forget that in just a few days after he was sworn in as president, he issued an executive order (EO) banning Muslims from certain countries from entering the U.S? The courts ruled the EO unconstitutional but Trump rewrote it as a 'travel ban' to make it more palatable to Federal judges. \"After seesawing through the lower and appellate courts, the EO eventually reached the Supreme Court where the conservative majority upheld Trump's travel ban on people coming from seven countries, five of which are predominantly Muslim countries - Syria, Iran, Libya, Yemen, Somalia. The other two are North Korea and Venezuela. Surmise it to say, these two countries were included in the 'travel ban' to avoid the EO from being branded as 'anti-Muslim'.\" Do you get my drift? In regard to the 'these [people] are animals' comment, I said: \"During a Cabinet meeting attended by news reporters, Trump vented his anger on the nation's immigration laws.\" At that meeting, New York Times reported on May 16, 2018: \"WASHINGTON -- President Trump lashed out at undocumented immigrants during a White House meeting on Wednesday, warning in front of news cameras that dangerous people were clamoring to breach the country's borders and branding such people 'animals.'\" He then \"exhorted his administration to 'do much better' in keeping out undesirable people, including members of transnational gangs like MS-13.\" In his initial comment when he used the word \"animals,\" Trump did not mention the MS-13 gang. However, he said later that the MS-13 as an example of \"members of of transnational gang\" without depicting them as \"animals.\" In other words, Trump never called \"the notorious MS-13 gang members as 'animals',\" which was what you claimed I didn't intentionally mention.\" Do you get my drift?
