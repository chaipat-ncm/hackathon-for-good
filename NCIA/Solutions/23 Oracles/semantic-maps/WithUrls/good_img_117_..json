According to Mr. Razeq, Taliban fighters had prepared 10 vehicles and 35 motorbikes to launch their attack, but during joint operations by Afghan police and intelligence special units 50 militants were killed and 20 others were injured. He added that some militants were also detained and their weapons had been seized. The Taliban group has not made a comment about the report yet.

The Pak-Afghan border has been closed for the last seven days, suspending Nato supplies and cross-border trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan after Afghan protesters burnt the Pakistani flag. According to sources, the fourth flag meeting was held at the Friendship Gate between border authorities of Pakistan and Afghanistan on the request of Afghan officials. Sources said that Afghan border officials once again urged Pakistani counterparts to reopen the border unconditionally without further delay as it was causing huge financial loss to the traders and businessmen from both sides. However, official sources said that Pakistani authorities made it clear that the border would be opened only after an apology was tendered by Afghan officials who provoked their compatriots into disrespecting the Pakistani flag. \"We have not received orders from the high command regarding reopening of the border with Afghanistan in Chaman so far,\" a senior Pakistani official said, adding that the high command was aware about the situation created after closure of border.

Five members of same family killed in house collapse Woman killed in road accident One month passed, Nirmala yet to get justice China's Didi apologises for safety lapses after murder ! HomeInternationalChina's Didi apologises for safety lapses after murder ! ShareTweet BEIJING, Aug 28, 2018 / China ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing issued an apology Tuesday for a string of lapses that led to the rape and murder of a passenger last week, the second such killing this year. The company has been slammed by observers, including China's transport ministry, over safety lapses after a 20-year-old female passenger was raped and murdered by her driver in the eastern city of Wenzhou on Friday, barely three months after a similar incident in May. Founder Cheng Wei and president Jean Liu apologised for their \"ignorance and pride\" in an emotive and lengthy note, promising an overhaul to ensure customer safety. \"Throughout the company we start to question if we are doing the right thing; or even whether we have the right values,\" said the statement sent out Tuesday evening. \"There is an enormous amount of self-doubt, guilt and soul-searching.\" The company has admitted it bore responsibility for the crime, failing to act on a complaint about the same driver from another passenger. In response to the fierce criticism that followed last week's killing, Didi announced the suspension of its Hitch service, which links up commuters travelling in the same direction. The company also said it would roll out an SOS button and offer an itinerary sharing function that allows users to share their journey with a chosen contact. Friday's murder follows the killing in May of a 21-year-old air stewardess by her driver as she was using the Hitch service. In 2016, a 24-year-old female passenger using the same service was robbed and murdered. China's transport ministry censured the company on Sunday, calling for it to improve its driver vetting and education processes, after the latest incident sparked furious online criticism of Didi. The firm has dominated Chinese media headlines for days and the topic \"female passenger killed on Didi Hitch\" has been trending on the Weibo microblogging site.

Afghanistan is experiencing political, social and security instability, as the Taliban movement and other radical extremist organizations such as Daesh, which is prohibited in many countries, including the United States and Russia, continue to stage attacks against civilian and state targets. \"According to some figures today, there are around 10,000 [Daesh militants], though one year ago there were only a few hundred. Most are coming naturally from being squeezed out of Syria and Iraq into Afghanistan. This is a serious threat to us,\" Bordyuzha told journalists. Daesh is quietly expanding in Afghanistan, gathering strength and waiting for the right moment to take action, the head of the Russian Foreng Ministry[d Department for Asian countries earlier stated. The United States, on the other hand, believes that the group's presence in Afghanistan has significantly decreased due to the US and Afghan forces' \"constant pressure\" on the terrorists. sputniknews.com/ Filed Under: West Asia Archivi Archivi Seleziona mese marzo 2018 (13) febbraio 2018 (173) gennaio 2018 (216) dicembre 2017 (150) novembre 2017 (246) ottobre 2017 (234) settembre 2017 (171) agosto 2017 (284) luglio 2017 (190) giugno 2017 (192) maggio 2017 (150) aprile 2017 (328) marzo 2017 (323) febbraio 2017 (343) gennaio 2017 (329) dicembre 2016 (295) novembre 2016 (198) ottobre 2016 (310) settembre 2016 (211) agosto 2016 (263) luglio 2016 (276) giugno 2016 (272) maggio 2016 (351) aprile 2016 (239) marzo 2016 (204) febbraio 2016 (302) gennaio 2016 (545) dicembre 2015 (427) novembre 2015 (443) ottobre 2015 (554) settembre 2015 (597) agosto 2015 (379) luglio 2015 (355) giugno 2015 (500) maggio 2015 (453) aprile 2015 (423) marzo 2015 (399) febbraio 2015 (327) gennaio 2015 (274) dicembre 2014 (118) novembre 2014 (61) ottobre 2014 (87) settembre 2014 (52) agosto 2014 (12) gennaio 2014 (46) dicembre 2013 (87) novembre 2013 (6) Articoli recenti Today's foreign Islamic terrorist fighters in a European-historical perspective 2 marzo 2018 Jihadist attack (Ansar ul Islam?) in Burkina Faso's capital 2 marzo 2018 Why Turkey is turning into the next Pakistan 2 marzo 2018 UAE is developing its Al-Khadim air base in eastern Libya 2 marzo 2018 The German Taliban 2 marzo 2018 Copyright (c) 2018 * Andrea Spada * Log inQuesto sito utilizza cookie anche di terzi per assicurare una migliore esperienza di navigazione.

Threat Intelligence Counter Terrorism Geopolitik Defence Intelligence Cyber Intelligence Situation Reports Senior Taliban Leader Killed in Eastern Afgan Province of Laghman written by Moshe Megged March 31, 2017 Another Taliban terror group senior leaders, Nasir Ahmad, has been killed in a special operation in eastern Laghman province of Afghanistan, local media reported citing provincial governor's spokesman. According to local news Ahmad was involved in major roadside bombings and other terrorist related activities. This was the second attempt to kill or arrest Taliban senior in two months. Earlier in March, another Taliban key leader Abdul Wali was eliminated during a fighting between the Afghan security forces and the terrorists in the same province. Afghanistan is experiencing political, social and security instability, in particular, due to the activity of the Taliban that has been controlling a number of regions and settlements across the country. The radical group is taking steps to establish a strict Sharia law on the controlled territories. The crisis in the country prompted the emergence of local cells of other extremist organizations such as Daesh, which is banned in many countries, including Russia. .u745891179e845009e9b7b9aa00c42ac9 { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#E67E22; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid inherit!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .u745891179e845009e9b7b9aa00c42ac9:active, .u745891179e845009e9b7b9aa00c42ac9:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .u745891179e845009e9b7b9aa00c42ac9 { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .u745891179e845009e9b7b9aa00c42ac9 .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .u745891179e845009e9b7b9aa00c42ac9 .postTitle { color:inherit; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .u745891179e845009e9b7b9aa00c42ac9:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Read Also: Terror Suspect Nuseiba Mohammed Haji Osman Linked With Botched Anthrax Attack Arraigned in Court 0 comment 0 Facebook Twitter Google + Pinterest Moshe Megged previous post Afghan Army Kills 45 Taliban Militants in Airstrikes in Country's South Helmand Province next post The Impending End of Al-Shabaab Terrorist Group in Somalia You may also like 4 Terrorists Linked to Deadly Cairo Church Bombing...

They essentially do it when their existence is threatened or for consolidation of power in an alien territory. It helps them to expand their scope, scale of operations, and influence. Moreover, it also helps them to foster human resource, wealth, technology and ideas. This is quite true for the Islamic State. Despite its so-called defeat in Iraq, the militant group has survived on the scores of loyalists left behind in Syria and parts of Iraq. It is now looking to expand its influence by shifting its headquarters and franchises elsewhere. Moreover, it is also seeking to regroup all their leftover fighters in the region. Many experts and officials believe that the group still poses a potent threat to regional security. As Iranian intelligence minister stated that \"ISIS has lost land, but has not surrendered its arms, and is looking for land in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia in order to revive the idea of an Islamic caliphate.\" Likewise, General John Nicholson said that \"right now we see them very focused on trying to establish their Khorasan caliphate inside Afghanistan.\" Furthermore, the statistics show that the estimated structure of IS in Afghanistan varies. According to an Afghan security official, there were estimated 4,000 IS fighters spread over Nangarhar province. Although the size of the group has fallen over a period of time, the support by the Afghan government and the US provides them the opportunity to expand their scope, scale and operations. Border clashes threaten Pak-Afghan thaw Yet, it is true that in the land of warlords, a foreign entity has never survived. 'Alexander the Great,' stuck by Afghan archers' arrows, barely managed an escape through the Indus River. Later on, the Moguls, the British and the Soviets, were vanquished and humiliated. This is one of the main reasons why the IS may not get its way with the Afghan populace. In addition, the IS's momentum is constrained by the fierce competition provided by the local insurgent groups. The group has a weak and unacceptable radical ideology. According to a report by the Middle East Institute, its two former commanders said that they joined the IS for a steady monthly income rather than its ideological appeal. Unlike the IS, the Taliban enjoy massive support within the Afghan population, driven as it is by religious ideology. No other group had ever enjoyed such acceptability and support. Therefore, the IS has to compete with other local groups which will further make things difficult for it. Even so, Afghanistan, a country with weak administrative set-up is quite vulnerable to terrorism. Sardar, a young barber living in Kunduz, said that Afghan government officials had asked him for hefty bribes to resolve a long-running family dispute over land. When this happened, he turned to the Taliban who in his home in Chahar Darah resolved the issue in 48 hours. However, the weak physical, economic, social and political deprivations as well as a lack of assets and income, reflect the vulnerability that captures the uninsured risks. These factors offer incentives for insurgent and terrorist groups that exploit the grievances and vulnerabilities of the local populace to engineer and keep the strategic cause alive. This helps them in recruitment and funding and garners moral and political support. Such state of affairs provides them the variety to stick to the same cause, until another one looks more profitable. Top Islamic State commander in Afghanistan killed in airstrike: officials On the other hand, the US and Afghan governments may like to support the IS, in response to Pakistan's alleged support for the Afghan Taliban. Furthermore, it is very likely that the US will support the outfit to sabotage the CPEC, which is seen as the primary threat to US hegemony. It is too early however to predict the rise of IS in Afghanistan. But if that does happen it will surely complicate the regional security equation.

The CPEC, widely dubbed as a game changer for the future of Pakistan, Saudi Arabia's entry to this landmark venture could qualify as a welcome news, especially since it sets a precedent for investors from other countries. Geo-strategically, this development serves to profoundly influence the future dynamics of the CPEC regionally while making a boost to OBOR's (One Belt One Road) trans-regional connectivity. During PM's Imran Khan's latest visit to Riyadh last month, Saudi Arabia has agreed to give Islamabad $3 billion in foreign currency support for a year, as well as a $3 billion loan in deferred oil import payments for three years, to help ease Pakistan's economic crisis. Pakistan's initiative- to offer Saudi Arabia as CPEC's investment partner- is synonymous to influencing the geopolitical and geo-economic dynamics of the CPEC project, as well as of the region. Though tactically, Saudi partnership based on inwardly and outwardly orchestrated dynamics is being viewed as a major boost for cash-strapped Pakistan facing an economic crisis and critical balance of payments pressure, the entry yet seems to deliver some profound strategic implications. The government of Saudi Arabia has signed three bilateral grant/ agreements with Pakistan to finance three road infrastructure and energy projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The proposal given to Saudi rulers was to invest in CPEC projects on a bilateral basis yet not on trilateral basis. Both KSA and Pakistan agreed on developing an \"oil city\" in or around Gwadar in Balochistan. The project fosters new policy dynamics beyond the former regional power tussle dynamics, old style alliance formation or 'Zero-sum relationship' between different countries inside and outside the regions. Its spirit is cooperation and not confrontation; collaboration and not competition. As ties between Riyadh and Washington seem confused, Saudi Arabia drifts towards China \"Saudi Arabia has chosen to look at its relations with Asia in the light of rapidly changing geopolitics in the region and beyond. By linking China with the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will optimise trade potential and enhance energy security of China, Pakistan and the wider region, directly benefiting some three billion people in China, South Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East. Saudi Arabia is one of the many countries that have shown keen interest in participating in the development projects sponsored by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), primarily to relate its economy with China and take steps in achieving its 2030's Vision. The KSA vision- 2030 Plan is to make the diverse economy in mega projects like powerhouses and energy to turn from its oil dependency. One of pillars of their vision plans to use its unique location and become a global hub for vast economic activities. For decades, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have maintained a unique alliance, rooted in Al Saud's self-anointed religious legitimacy, the strength and expertise of Pakistan's military, the two states' common geopolitical interests and the 1.5 million Pakistani labourers in the Kingdom. The Saudis see Pakistan, which shares a 565-mile border with Iran and is the only Muslim nation with nuclear weapons, as a vital ally capable of serving as an effective peace mediator in the Muslim world. The Pakistani military has maintained robust intelligence cooperation with Saudi Arabia since 1967. Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Sultan Al Saud famously described Saudi Arabia-Pakistan military cooperation as \"probably one of the closest relationships in the world between any two countries.\" And most significantly, while maintaining our neutrality in Yemen, Pakistan duly shares its policy stake holder-ship in KSA's formed IMAFT where the former Army chief Gen Raheel Sharif heads its command. Yet, pragmatism suggests that both States must sign a bilateral security pact. While Islamabad is genuinely concerned about India's growing ties with GCC, it is also thoughtful about US-plan to create an Arab-NATO under Bahrain's captaincy since it may trigger a new geopolitical game in the region. Therefore, Islamabad has taken a right step to mediate in the Yemen War. With Saudi's determination to invest in Pakistan via CPEC forum will positively reshape the geopolitical aspects of the CPEC project since this will deepen the CPEC linkage to Middle Eastern-OPEC affiliated states and the GCC. Furthermore, with Saudi Arabia's extending interest into the CPEC development-investment the core of the Pakistan developing economy index will go upward. Yet in the changing geopolitics, Islamabad's rebalancing ties with both Riyadh and Tehran are important. Tehran is also showing its interest to participate in this development trajectory. It is a win-win project for everybody in the region and beyond. China is obviously changing the strategic culture through its island-building efforts and its sheer economic importance to its neighbours via Corridor's developmental synergy. As for China, the Corridor prevents the US from expanding its influence in Southeast Asia thereby influencing the perspective dynamics of Sino-US strategic rivalry Moreover, while seeing from a geostrategic angle, Riyadh's role as an investor into the CPEC may not only assist Islamabad's development drive into Gilgit-Baltistan region but also counter India's divide et impera stratagem against the Muslim Ummah. And it seems a worthy scenario that in all avenues, this growing interwoven strategic partnership between a Muslim nuclear power Pakistan and the founding OIC member KSA will further cement unity and friendship between two traditional partners at political, economic and military to military levels. -- The writer, an independent 'IR' researcher-cum- analyst based in Pakistan, is member of European Consortium for Political Research Standing Group on IR, Critical Peace & Conflict Studies, also a member of European Society of International Law (ESIL).

/ 11:20 PM / 3 years agoNATO wants Afghan forces to do less defending, more attackingJosh Smith, Mirwais Harooni6 Min ReadKABUL (Reuters) - NATO advisers want Afghan soldiers to spend less time manning checkpoints and more taking the fight to Taliban militants, a key tactical shift the coalition hopes will enable local forces to quell a rising insurgency. Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers prepare to leave for a patrol in Logar province, Afghanistan February 16, 2016. REUTERS/Omar SobhaniWith NATO's combat mission officially over, and only a few thousand foreign troops left, the onus has fallen on the Afghan army and police to impose stability, and the military alliance is looking for ways to use those resources more effectively. Reducing reliance on thousands of poorly defended checkpoints that dot towns and roads across the country is a priority for NATO heading into summer, when fighting is expected to intensify as the Taliban renews its push to seize back power. \"They've got way too many soldiers on checkpoints,\" said Brigadier-General Wilson Shoffner, spokesman for the NATO-led training mission known as Resolute Support. \"There's an old military saying that if you defend everywhere you defend nowhere, and it's very much true for them (Afghan security forces).\" There are early signs the idea is catching on. Over the past week, army units in the embattled province of Helmand abandoned their outposts in several of the most disputed areas, a move officials said would allow them to consolidate forces for renewed attacks on insurgent strongholds. \"We have decided to pull out our troops from their defensive role and prepare them for an aggressive role in the coming year,\" said General Murad Ali Murad, commander of the Afghan army's ground forces. \"We are providing them with serious training and better equipment in order to prepare for a spring offensive.\" But countrywide, obstacles remain to changing tactics long favored by security forces. Despite providing the enemy with an obvious target, checkpoints are still simpler to defend than launching mobile operations, which require logistics and air support often beyond the reach of limited Afghan resources. Politics can also complicate efforts to change strategy, Shoffner said. \"If you're a local chief of police or village elder, you want as many checkpoints as you can get around your village. So we often have conflict between the Afghan army that is trying to reduce checkpoints and the (local) leaders ... that want them.\" \"CHECKPOINTS STOP THE TALIBAN\" South of Kabul, members of the Afghan National Army's 1st battalion, 111th Capital Division hold a string of checkpoints to secure the mountain passes between the Afghan capital and Logar province. Of roughly 600 soldiers in the battalion, more than 500 are based at checkpoints, while a small, more heavily armed mobile reserve force remains at a central base, said battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Mohammed Reya Khuram. \"We have to have checkpoints to stop the Taliban,\" Khuram told Reuters. \"If we are not there, the Taliban will be.\" The outposts range from small earthen forts strung with barbed wire, to makeshift dugouts and shacks perched on rocky slopes. Many have no vehicles of their own, limiting troops' ability to venture far without help from the central base. While the area is not among the most violent in the country, soldiers say they are regularly targeted by Taliban snipers and find roadside bombs. The Defence Ministry referred Reuters' requests for comment for this article to Major General Abdul Nasir Ziaee, 111th Division commander. He said checkpoints were not necessarily wrong. \"We have two groups of soldiers at each checkpost. One is the security group and another is the reaction group,\" he said. \"The security group patrols and the other one responds to attacks, or when they get a report they react.\" But recent examples underline the risk of relying on static defenses. This month, insurgents used captured military vehicles to attack a checkpoint in Helmand, southern Afghanistan, killing seven soldiers and 15 policemen. In the east, checkpoints were among the first targets for militants supporting Islamic State when they attacked last year. When troops fail to leave forts to conduct patrols and operations, it allows insurgents to place roadside bombs and mines, further restricting the military's ability to move, according to coalition officers. Western officials privately estimate the Taliban are contesting as much territory as at any time since their regime was toppled in 2001, underlining the need to wrest back the initiative. Government forces, numbering more than 300,000 including soldiers and police, are only fully in charge of about 70 percent of the country, the U.S. military says. Outposts can be a key part of disrupting insurgent movement, NATO military officers say, and during more than a decade of combat operations the coalition itself fought fiercely to establish small bases in Taliban strongholds in eastern and southern Afghanistan. Slideshow (5 Images)But fewer, stronger outposts can be an advantage, Shoffner argued. \"The idea is to reduce checkpoints and to consolidate onto strong points, so that not only does that strong point have the strength to defend itself, but so it also has a maneuver capability,\" Shoffner said. \"So if there is a security situation in a nearby village or checkpoint, it's got enough combat power to overwhelm whatever the security threat is.\" Editing by Mike Collett-WhiteOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The officials of the Frontier Corps (FC) were reviewing arrangements to erect fences on the Pak-Afghan border in Kurram agency when the incident of unprovoked firing occurred. The Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said. The Pakistan Army, it may be recalled, is in the process of fencing the porous Pak-Afghan border in a bid to stem the free-flow of militants and cross border violation. \"FC KP troops were fired upon from Afghanistan side in Kurram agency. Troops were carrying out routine surveillance along Pak Afghan border for plugging of gaps and making necessary preparations for starting fencing in that area. 2 FC soldiers martyred and 5 injured. Pakistani troops are exercising maximum restraint so as to avoid any Afghan civilian casualties. Military engagement is underway to defuse situation\". The ISPR communique says.It could, however, could not be ascertained as to who were the attackers , the militants from Afghanistan or the members of the Afghan Army that also do not spare opportunity to resort to ambushes on Pakistani forces. It may be mentioned that that two Pakistani soldiers lost their lives in cross-border attack on April 7 and 8, besides injuries to several others. The naked aggression from across the border, it may be recalled has continued unabated in our tribal belt since long.

The CPEC, widely dubbed as a game changer for the future of Pakistan, Saudi Arabia's entry to this landmark venture could qualify as a welcome news, especially since it sets a precedent for investors from other countries. Geo-strategically, this development serves to profoundly influence the future dynamics of the CPEC regionally while making a boost to OBOR's (One Belt One Road) trans-regional connectivity. During PM's Imran Khan's latest visit to Riyadh last month, Saudi Arabia has agreed to give Islamabad $3 billion in foreign currency support for a year, as well as a $3 billion loan in deferred oil import payments for three years, to help ease Pakistan's economic crisis. Pakistan's initiative- to offer Saudi Arabia as CPEC's investment partner- is synonymous to influencing the geopolitical and geo-economic dynamics of the CPEC project, as well as of the region. Though tactically, Saudi partnership based on inwardly and outwardly orchestrated dynamics is being viewed as a major boost for cash-strapped Pakistan facing an economic crisis and critical balance of payments pressure, the entry yet seems to deliver some profound strategic implications. The government of Saudi Arabia has signed three bilateral grant/ agreements with Pakistan to finance three road infrastructure and energy projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The proposal given to Saudi rulers was to invest in CPEC projects on a bilateral basis yet not on trilateral basis. Both KSA and Pakistan agreed on developing an \"oil city\" in or around Gwadar in Balochistan. The project fosters new policy dynamics beyond the former regional power tussle dynamics, old style alliance formation or 'Zero-sum relationship' between different countries inside and outside the regions. Its spirit is cooperation and not confrontation; collaboration and not competition. As ties between Riyadh and Washington seem confused, Saudi Arabia drifts towards China \"Saudi Arabia has chosen to look at its relations with Asia in the light of rapidly changing geopolitics in the region and beyond. By linking China with the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will optimise trade potential and enhance energy security of China, Pakistan and the wider region, directly benefiting some three billion people in China, South Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East. Saudi Arabia is one of the many countries that have shown keen interest in participating in the development projects sponsored by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), primarily to relate its economy with China and take steps in achieving its 2030's Vision. The KSA vision- 2030 Plan is to make the diverse economy in mega projects like powerhouses and energy to turn from its oil dependency. One of pillars of their vision plans to use its unique location and become a global hub for vast economic activities. For decades, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have maintained a unique alliance, rooted in Al Saud's self-anointed religious legitimacy, the strength and expertise of Pakistan's military, the two states' common geopolitical interests and the 1.5 million Pakistani labourers in the Kingdom. The Saudis see Pakistan, which shares a 565-mile border with Iran and is the only Muslim nation with nuclear weapons, as a vital ally capable of serving as an effective peace mediator in the Muslim world. The Pakistani military has maintained robust intelligence cooperation with Saudi Arabia since 1967. Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Sultan Al Saud famously described Saudi Arabia-Pakistan military cooperation as \"probably one of the closest relationships in the world between any two countries.\" And most significantly, while maintaining our neutrality in Yemen, Pakistan duly shares its policy stake holder-ship in KSA's formed IMAFT where the former Army chief Gen Raheel Sharif heads its command. Yet, pragmatism suggests that both States must sign a bilateral security pact. While Islamabad is genuinely concerned about India's growing ties with GCC, it is also thoughtful about US-plan to create an Arab-NATO under Bahrain's captaincy since it may trigger a new geopolitical game in the region. Therefore, Islamabad has taken a right step to mediate in the Yemen War. With Saudi's determination to invest in Pakistan via CPEC forum will positively reshape the geopolitical aspects of the CPEC project since this will deepen the CPEC linkage to Middle Eastern-OPEC affiliated states and the GCC. Furthermore, with Saudi Arabia's extending interest into the CPEC development-investment the core of the Pakistan developing economy index will go upward. Yet in the changing geopolitics, Islamabad's rebalancing ties with both Riyadh and Tehran are important. Tehran is also showing its interest to participate in this development trajectory. It is a win-win project for everybody in the region and beyond. China is obviously changing the strategic culture through its island-building efforts and its sheer economic importance to its neighbours via Corridor's developmental synergy. As for China, the Corridor prevents the US from expanding its influence in Southeast Asia thereby influencing the perspective dynamics of Sino-US strategic rivalry Moreover, while seeing from a geostrategic angle, Riyadh's role as an investor into the CPEC may not only assist Islamabad's development drive into Gilgit-Baltistan region but also counter India's divide et impera stratagem against the Muslim Ummah. And it seems a worthy scenario that in all avenues, this growing interwoven strategic partnership between a Muslim nuclear power Pakistan and the founding OIC member KSA will further cement unity and friendship between two traditional partners at political, economic and military to military levels. -- The writer, an independent 'IR' researcher-cum- analyst based in Pakistan, is member of European Consortium for Political Research Standing Group on IR, Critical Peace & Conflict Studies, also a member of European Society of International Law (ESIL).

Thick haze engulfs Delhi, air quality remains in 'severe' category Authorities said rains in some parts of the national capital has made the air heavier and increased pollution. The EPCA said heavy vehicles would now ply in the city on normal timings between 11PM to 6 AM.

The study, for which around 5,000 people in 17 cities were interviewed, found that the top four reasons behind bad air quality were pollution caused by motor vehicles (74 per cent), industrial units (58 per cent), tree cutting (56.9 per cent) and construction (48.2 per cent).

The latest development came after the three- judge bench headed by chief justice put injunction on President's gazette till 7 December and will hold further hearings from 5 December. The court also ordered the Elections Commission to halt preparations for the general elections scheduled for January 5. United National Party (UNP) led by Wickremsinghe welcomed the decision terming it as end of coup. Wickremsinghe said in a message the order shows President is not above law and can't play around with constitution. President Sirisena held a meeting of security council last night and ordered security forces to maintain security throughout the country. The political crisis in Sri Lanka began when President Maithripala Sirisena appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as new Prime minister replacing Ranil Wickremsinghe. He followed it with prorogation of Parliament and finally with dissolution. PM outlines India's digital revolution in his keynote address at Singapore Fintech Festival The first head of government to address the world's largest FINTECH Festival, Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared lessons India has learnt during the financial inclusion journey launched in 2014. Singapore and India have been partners in the boosting Fintech. In another step towards enhancing global financial inclusion, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched APIX or Application Programming Interface Exchange, a global fintech platform along with Deputy PM of Singapore T. Shanmugaratnam. This comes after the global launch of the RuPay card in Singapore in June, earlier this year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that digital transactions contribute to nation building. Every digital payment saves time. It adds to a huge national saving. It is increasing productivity of individuals and our economy. It also helps improve tax collection and inject fairness in the economy. Even more, digital payments are a gateway to a world of possibilities. Prime Minister hailed inspiring stories of extraordinary innovations that are transforming lives across the world. He also spelt out challenges that remain. Prime Minister Modi called for the inclusion of the unbanked 1.7 billion people in the world into the formal financial market. He called for the extension of social security to more than a billion workers in the informal sectors worldwide. Banks and financial institutions must be made more resilient in managing risks, fighting frauds and dealing with disruption of traditional models. Prime Minister called for the use of technology to improve compliance, regulation and supervision, so that innovation flourishes and risks are contained. He also stressed on the use of Fintech tools to combat money laundering and other financial crimes including cyber threats. We can use Fintech to ensure that no dream remains unfulfilled, and no enterprise remains still born, because of lack of access to finance. PATCH Fintech will need to be not merely a mechanism but a movement. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also visited the India Pavilion at the Singapore Fintech Festival. With 18 participants, India Pavilion has the highest number of companies among the 16 country pavilions in the Exhibition.

The court has put injunction on gazette till 7 December and will hold further hearings from 5th December.

Retail inflation falls to one-year low of 3.31 per cent Official data released on Monday showed that the inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 3.7 per cent in September 2018 and 3.58 per cent in October 2017. The retail inflation number is the lowest since September 2017 when it touched 3.28 per cent. According to the Central Statistics Office data, the rate of price rise in the food basket contracted by 0.86 per cent in October compared to 0.51 per cent rise in September. Vegetable prices declined by 8.06 per cent in October against a 4.15 per cent contraction in September. Inflation also slowed to 0.35 per cent in the fruit basket as against 1.12 per cent recorded a month ago. The retail inflation also cooled in protein-rich items like cereals, eggs, milk and related products. However, inflation quickened to 8.55 per cent for the 'fuel and light' category against 8.47 per cent in the previous month Stan Lee, creator of Spider-Man and other Marvel superheroes, dies at 95 As a writer and editor, Lee was key to the ascension of \\Marvel into a comic book titan in the 1960s when, in collaboration with artists such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he created superheroes who would enthrall generations of young readers. Lee's daughter J.C. Lee confirmed the death to Reuters. Americans were familiar with superheroes before Lee, in part thanks to the 1938 launch of Superman by Detective Comics, the company that would become DC Comics, Marvel's archrival. Lee was widely credited with adding a new layer of complexity and humanity to superheroes. His characters were not made of stone - even if they appeared to have been chiseled from granite. They had love and money worries and endured tragic flaws or feelings of insecurity. He had help in designing the superheroes but he took full ownership of promoting them. His creations included web-slinging teenager Spider-Man, the muscle-bound Hulk, mutant outsiders The X-Men, the close-knit Fantastic Four and the playboy-inventor Tony Stark, better known as Iron Man. Dozens of Marvel Comics movies, with nearly all the major characters Lee created, were produced in the first decades of the 21st century, grossing over $20 billion at theaters worldwide, according to box office analysts. Spider-Man is one of the most successfully licensed characters ever and he has soared through the New York skyline as a giant inflatable in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Lee, as a hired hand at Marvel, received limited payback on the windfall from his characters. Amnesty strips Aung San Suu Kyi of highest honour The London-based global human rights organisation said it was revoking the Ambassador of Conscience Award it gave Suu Kyi in 2009 while she was still under house arrest. \"Today, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defence of human rights,\" Amnesty International chief Kumi Naidoo said in a letter to Suu Kyi released by the group. \"Amnesty International cannot justify your continued status as a recipient of the Ambassador of Conscience award and so with great sadness we are hereby withdrawing it from you.\" The group said it informed Suu Kyi of the decision on Sunday. She has so far issued no public response. Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) party swept to power in 2015 in a landslide victory ending decades of military rule in the southeast Asian country of around 50 million. But her tenure has been marred by a failure to speak up for Rohingya Muslims who were driven out of the country by the army in what the United Nations has called an ethnic cleansing campaign. The 73-year-old was stripped of her honourary Canadian citizenship over her failure to speak up for the Rohingyas last month. She has also lost numerous smaller awards from individual universities and local and regional governments. More than 720,000 Rohingya Muslims fled the Buddhist majority's western Rakhine state in a military crackdown from August last year. Many are believed to have been either murdered or tortured and raped. Suu Kyi was globally hailed as a freedom fighter who stood up to her country's feared military dictatorship while spending 15 years under house arrest. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. PM dedicates inland waterways terminal on river Ganga in Varanasi Bowing his head in salutation to Ma Ganga, Prime Minister Narendra Modi scripted a landmark moment in the history of connectivity in India......History in the making...Prime Minister Narendra Modi receiving the country's first container consignment to be sent on an inland waterways vessel. It is perhaps for the first time that a Prime Minister operated a cargo crane... This consignment containing cargo of the food and beverage company Pepsico set sail from Kolkata in the last week of October. Development of inland waterways superbly complements the Modi government's historic Sagarmala project. The prime objective of the project is to promote port-led direct and indirect development and to provide infrastructure to transport goods to and from ports quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively. Prime Minister also dedicated to the nation an inland waterways terminal on river Ganga in Varanasi. This is the first of the four multi modal terminals being constructed on National Waterways-I as part of the World Bank aided Jal Marg Vikas project of the Inland Waterways Authority of India. It connects India to Bangladesh via the inland waterway route. Later National waterway 2 will extend connectivity to the North East. The other three terminals are under construction at Sahibganj, Haldia and Gazipur. The project would enable commercial navigation of vessels with capacity of 1500-2,000 DWT on river Ganga. It has been developed at a cost of Rs 5369 Cr. Apart from this 2 intermodal terminals and 5 RO RO terminals are also being planned. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a walk around the Jetty. Currently, India has about 14,500 km of navigable waterways which comprise of rivers, canals, backwaters, and creeks. The country first river communication system will ensure safe navigation on this route. Not only this, a cruise model is also being developed for the Kumbh Mela next year for the benefit of devotees. PM launches landmark projects in Varanasi Prime Minister Narendra Modi gifting Varanasi with infrastructure projects worth over Rs 2,412 crores as part of his all pervaisive Vikas Mantra. He dedicated to the nation, two important national highways in Varanasi. With a total length of 34 kilometres they have been constructed at a cost of Rs 1571.95 crore. The Varanasi Ring Road, with two Rail Over Bridges and a flyover provides a bypass for traffic on 3 National Highways, thereby reducing traffic congestion in the city. This will also reduce travel time, fuel usage and pollution in the area and will provide easier access to Sarnath on the Buddhist circuit. The Babatpur Airport highway links Varanasi to the airport and goes on to Jaunpur, Sultanpur and Lucknow. The road will reduce the travel time from Varanasi to the airport. This will prove a big relief to the people of Varanasi and to tourists and other visitors to the city. Projects worth Rs 23,000 crore have already been sanctioned under the Namami Gange Mission. Prime Minister reiterated government's committment to this project. He laid the foundation stone for two STP plants in Varanasi. An additional 40 MLD capacity has been added to the 140 MLD capacity of the Sewage treatment plant in Dinapur. This will serve Varanasi till 2035. An effort is also being made to cap sewage contamination at Ramnagar. An STP plant of 10 MLD capacity is in the pipeline. Prime Minister also appreciated the Integrated Power Development Scheme, that transforms Varanasi and illuminates the lives of people. An enthusiastic public got carried away with their emotions at several points of time during the Prime Minister's address. Accepting their adulation with humility, Prime Minister asked them to conserve their energies for 2019. Clearly Prime Minister Narendra Modi is committed to Transforming Varanasi. Over the last four years he has left no stone unturned in this direction. Prime Minister Modi's latest development gifts to the city will provide increased employment opportunities, development of small and medium industries and give a boost to economic development in the area.

Photo: Reuters/Omar Sobhani The Taliban announced the start of their spring offensive on Tuesday, pledging to launch large-scale offensives against government strongholds backed by suicide and guerrilla attacks to drive Afghanistan's Western-backed government from power.The announcement of the formal start of \"Operation Omari\", named after the late Taliban founder Mullah Mohammad Omar, comes just days after Secretary of State John Kerry visited Kabul and reaffirmed U.S. support for the national unity government led by President Ashraf Ghani.\"Jihad against the aggressive and usurping infidel army is a holy obligation upon our necks and our only recourse for reestablishing an Islamic system and regaining our independence,\" the Taliban said in a statement.The insurgency has gained in strength since the withdrawal of international troops from combat at the end of 2014 and the Taliban are stronger than at any point since they were driven from power by U.S.-backed forces in 2001.As well as suicide and tactical attacks, the operation would include assassinations of enemy commanders in urban centers, the Taliban statement said.\"The present Operation will also employ all means at our disposal to bog the enemy down in a war of attrition that lowers the morale of the foreign invaders and their internal armed militias,\" it said.In line with recent statements, it also said it would establish good governance in areas it controlled as well as avoiding civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure.How far the announcement will lead to an immediate escalation in fighting, which caused 11,000 civilian casualties last year, remains unclear. However, NATO and Afghan officials have said they expect very tough combat in 2016.Heavy fighting has continued for months across Afghanistan, from Kunduz, the northern city that fell briefly to the insurgents last year, to Helmand province bordering Pakistan in the south.In Helmand, where thousands of British and American troops were killed or injured fighting the Taliban, government forces have pulled back from many areas and are struggling to hold on to centers close to the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah.Understrength Afghan security forces, struggling with heavy casualties and high desertion rates and short of air power, transport and logistical support, have struggled in their first year fighting largely alone.According to NATO commanders, the Taliban exerts control over only six percent of Afghanistan but up to a third of the country is at risk from the insurgents and government forces control no more than 70 percent of the country's territory.U.S. General John Nicholson, who took over as commander of international troops in Afghanistan last month, is conducting a strategic review, including plans to cut U.S. troops in Afghanistan from 9,800 to 5,500 by the end of the year.Unless the plan is changed, the reduction would mean the end of most of NATO's training and assistance operation, leaving the remaining U.S. troops focusing on counterterrorism operations against radical groups like Islamic State.

By Syed Sadam Hussain Shah Published: April 16, 2018 0SHARES Share Tweet Email Representational image. PHOTO: REUTERS Terror outfits often expand their influence by merging into other groups or by cobbling together alliances. They essentially do it when their existence is threatened or for consolidation of power in an alien territory. It helps them to expand their scope, scale of operations, and influence. Moreover, it also helps them to foster human resource, wealth, technology and ideas. This is quite true for the Islamic State. Despite its so-called defeat in Iraq, the militant group has survived on the scores of loyalists left behind in Syria and parts of Iraq. It is now looking to expand its influence by shifting its headquarters and franchises elsewhere. Moreover, it is also seeking to regroup all their leftover fighters in the region. Many experts and officials believe that the group still poses a potent threat to regional security. As Iranian intelligence minister stated that \"ISIS has lost land, but has not surrendered its arms, and is looking for land in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia in order to revive the idea of an Islamic caliphate.\" Likewise, General John Nicholson said that \"right now we see them very focused on trying to establish their Khorasan caliphate inside Afghanistan.\" Furthermore, the statistics show that the estimated structure of IS in Afghanistan varies. According to an Afghan security official, there were estimated 4,000 IS fighters spread over Nangarhar province. Although the size of the group has fallen over a period of time, the support by the Afghan government and the US provides them the opportunity to expand their scope, scale and operations. Border clashes threaten Pak-Afghan thaw Yet, it is true that in the land of warlords, a foreign entity has never survived. 'Alexander the Great,' stuck by Afghan archers' arrows, barely managed an escape through the Indus River. Later on, the Moguls, the British and the Soviets, were vanquished and humiliated. This is one of the main reasons why the IS may not get its way with the Afghan populace. In addition, the IS's momentum is constrained by the fierce competition provided by the local insurgent groups. The group has a weak and unacceptable radical ideology. According to a report by the Middle East Institute, its two former commanders said that they joined the IS for a steady monthly income rather than its ideological appeal. Unlike the IS, the Taliban enjoy massive support within the Afghan population, driven as it is by religious ideology. No other group had ever enjoyed such acceptability and support. Therefore, the IS has to compete with other local groups which will further make things difficult for it. Even so, Afghanistan, a country with weak administrative set-up is quite vulnerable to terrorism. Sardar, a young barber living in Kunduz, said that Afghan government officials had asked him for hefty bribes to resolve a long-running family dispute over land. When this happened, he turned to the Taliban who in his home in Chahar Darah resolved the issue in 48 hours. However, the weak physical, economic, social and political deprivations as well as a lack of assets and income, reflect the vulnerability that captures the uninsured risks. These factors offer incentives for insurgent and terrorist groups that exploit the grievances and vulnerabilities of the local populace to engineer and keep the strategic cause alive. This helps them in recruitment and funding and garners moral and political support. Such state of affairs provides them the variety to stick to the same cause, until another one looks more profitable. Top Islamic State commander in Afghanistan killed in airstrike: officials On the other hand, the US and Afghan governments may like to support the IS, in response to Pakistan's alleged support for the Afghan Taliban. Furthermore, it is very likely that the US will support the outfit to sabotage the CPEC, which is seen as the primary threat to US hegemony. It is too early however to predict the rise of IS in Afghanistan. But if that does happen it will surely complicate the regional security equation. Published in The Express Tribune, April 16th, 2018.

The tribesmen handle security in their Zazi Maidan district of Khost. The soldier and the bodies were handed to Pakistani troops, said Khost governor Hukum Khan Habibi. The dispute arose over Pakistan's work on a fence intended to span nearly the entire disputed 2,500-km border, much of it mountainous and porous. Afghan officials have alleged that Pakistani troops crossed onto Afghanistan soil, prompting firing on Sunday by border forces and the local tribal force. Border clashes threaten Pak-Afghan thaw The two sides later agreed on a ceasefire. The Pakistani military has previously said that two of its soldiers were killed. An Afghan army commander has said two tribesmen were killed in the skirmish. A spokesperson for the Pakistan Army could not be immediately reached.

Posted on January 4, 2018Cause of US anger not Pakistan but formation of hostile front: Gulbuddin Hekmatyar Written byThe Frontier Post Posted inAfghanistan Comments Leave a comment KABUL (AFP): Former Afghan prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar said on Friday that the cause of the United States anger is not lack of cooperation from Pakistan but the formation of a hostile front against the US. The former Afghan prime minister was speaking to an Afghan news channel in an interview, where he commented on the recent political scenario in wake of US President Donald Trump's anti-Pakistan statements. The reason for stopping US aid is not Pakistan's lack of cooperation, the US knows that a new front is being formed against it in the region, said the former Afghan warlord. Hekmatyar further said that due to the fear of an opposing front, the US is adopting a strict narrative against Pakistan. The US in a recent statement said that it is withholding aid worth $255 million to Pakistan following Trump's tweet. He had said the US had foolishly given Pakistan more than $33 billion in financial assistance over the past 15 years. The White House on Tuesday said it wanted to see Pakistan do more to fight terrorism and that it would likely announce actions to pressure Islamabad within days. \"Our goal is that we know that they can do more to stop terrorism and we want them to do that,\" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. In a tweet on Monday, US President Donald Trump accused Pakistan of giving nothing but lies and deceit, thinking US leaders to be fools. \"They give safe havens to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!\" he had said.

Posted on January 4, 2018NSC, NDS dismiss Noor's allegations as baseless Written byThe Frontier Post Posted inAfghanistan Comments Leave a comment Monitoring Desk KABUL: The National Security Council of Afghanistan and the Afghan Intelligence or National Directorate of Security dismissed the allegations by Ata Mohammad Noor as baseless. The Office of the National Security Council (NSC) in a statement said it rejects the allegations against the Office of the National Security Council as alleged during a gathering in Mazar-e-Sharif city. The statement further added that the NSC office has no guesthouse in the mentioned address and the information provided are baseless. The Afghan Intelligence, National Directorate of Security (NDS), had earlier also rejected the allegations by the chief executive of Jamiat-e-Islami. The statement by NDS states that the guesthouse mentioned during gathering belongs to the new governor of Balkh province and that the VIP protection unit has the security responsibility of the compound. The statement further added that the intelligence has no links or work with the guesthouse of Engineer Daud. This comes as Noor claimed that certain circles belonging to the government intelligence are attempting to spark chaos and destabilize Balkh province. Speaking during a gathering and among his supporters in Balkh province, Noor said some circles belonging to the intelligence department have started to distribute weapons among the people. Noor did not provide further information regarding his new claims but added that the government is attempting to destabilize the Balkh province. Posted on January 4, 2018Raziq admits involvement in extrajudicial killings Written byThe Frontier Post Posted inAfghanistan Comments Leave a comment Monitoring Desk KANDAHAR: Admitting involvement in extrajudicial killings, the police chief of Kandahar province, General Abdul Raziq, has said sweets are not distributed among rivals in war. Different human rights organizations including the UN Committee against Torture alleged that Kandahar police was responsible for enforced disappearances, mass arbitrary detention and extrajudicial killings during counter-insurgency operations. \"The Committee is particularly concerned at the numerous and credible allegations indicating General Abdul Raziq, ANP Commander in Kandahar, as being widely suspected of complicity, if not of personal implication, in severe human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and settlement of secret detention centres,\" the committee said in a report released in mid-last year. Talking to journalists here on Wednesday General said they kill the Taliban because no one distributes sweets in the war. \"A soldier can carry four magazines and a Kalashnikov, not a court or any other judicial organ,\" he said. He, however, rejected the allegations that he was running personal jails, saying the prisoners were being kept only in the government run jails. He accused unnamed government officials of creating insecurity and eliminating some political figures. The Kandahar police chief said they had picked arms against the country sellers, not for getting power. Posted on January 4, 2018Tajikistan reopens border with Afghanistan Written byThe Frontier Post Posted inAfghanistan Comments Leave a comment Monitoring Desk KUNDUZ CITY: After a two-week closure, Tajikistan has reopened its border crossing with Afghanistan in northern Kunduz province for traffic to Sher Khan Port, an official said. About two weeks back, Tajikistan police closed the main border crossing with Afghanistan, Sher Khan Port, and the highway between the countries for traffic. However, Provincial Trade Union Head Syed Mujtaba Hashimi told Pajhwok Afghan News the Tajik police reopened the highway for traders and visitors on Monday. He said the highway had been closed in Sher Khan Port due to unknown reasons by Tajik border police. \"Only transit goods were allowed, but people and Afghan trucks remained stranded on both sides.\" Meanwhile, a trader in Sher Khan Port, Haji Fahim, said the border closure faced businessmen with serious problems. \"The traders' goods were stuck on the other side of the border for two weeks.\" The spokesman for the governor of Takhar province, Niamatullah Temori, also confirmed the crossing point's reopening and said: \"We have sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take proactive steps for preventing such issues in future.'' Although it is not yet ascertained why the highway between the two neighbors was closed, but some sources say recent mysterious killing of a number of Tajik border guards prompted the move.
