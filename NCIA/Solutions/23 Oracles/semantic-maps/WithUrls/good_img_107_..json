(Photo: EEAS) By Giulia Lagana London, 7. Jul 2017, 09:02 Last week, as health workers, volunteers and police officers in southern Italian ports scrambled to identify, assist and send over 10,000 newly arrived migrants to reception facilities, the Italian government threatened to stop allowing NGO rescue ships to disembark migrants at its ports. The EU and its member states acknowledged that Italy's capacity to host those attempting the sea crossing from Libya is reaching its limits, but did very little to help beyond pledging some additional funds and endorsing an Italian proposal to draft a code of conduct for the NGOs.

Watch our founder Lisbeth Kirk explain the reasons in this 30 seconds video. Some governments, including the German and Belgian ones, stated publicly that they would not take in any of the rescued migrants, while Austria threatened to send its army to seal the border with Italy. The Italian government is right to claim that other EU states are failing to provide meaningful support by taking in some of the people who are arriving, and that it is currently managing the main source of irregular migration to Europe single-handedly. However, Italy has chosen to respond to a real problem with the wrong solution. The code of conduct lays out a series of obligations for the rescue groups, including allowing investigative police on board at all times - a clear breach of the principle of neutrality upheld by humanitarian NGOs - as well as a prohibition on entering Libyan territorial waters and not obstructing the Libyan coast guard's rescue operations. NGOs that do not comply are threatened with not being granted access to Italy's ports. NGOs worry that the code of conduct is an attempt to either ensure that they cease their operations altogether or to limit their ability to witness and document abuses perpetrated by the EU-trained and equipped Libyan coast guard. Over the past few weeks, such incidents include Libyan officers being filmed shooting at migrant boats. The code has also been criticised by the UN, which says it is unnecessary as international maritime law and specific guidelines issued jointly by the International Maritime Organization and the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) already apply. Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR's special envoy for the Central Mediterranean, said at a recent event in Brussels that \"the code should apply to all actors, not just the NGOs, including commercial vessels which switch off their transponders [radar identification systems], to avoid being asked to carry out rescue operations, and Nato ships, which routinely ignore distress calls\". The Italian coast guard have privately voiced concerns that, if the NGOs cease operating, they will not have the capacity to save the thousands of people risking their lives every day to reach Italy and that there will be countless more deaths on an already deadly route. If the Italian authorities try to implement the code of conduct, migrants and refugees in desperate conditions, who have endured abuse and violence in Libya, and risked their lives in the Mediterranean, would be forced to endure additional days at sea while states tussle over which port they should be taken to - a frequent occurrence in the early 2000s. And if any other EU country did allow some migrants to disembark - an unlikely event - it would be much further away from the waters off the coast of Libya than Italy. The decision could also violate international law, under which seafarers must take rescued persons to the nearest \"safe port\" - not just from a logistical point of view, but where their rights would not be violated as well. These provisions currently bar ships in the Central Mediterranean, where all rescue operations are coordinated by the Italian coast guard, from taking migrants not just to Libya, but also to Egypt, Tunisia and other non-European countries in the region. The rest of the EU should step up to help Italy host the migrants and asylum seekers, but there is little willingness across the bloc to do this. A decision by the EU in 2015 to redistribute 160,000 asylum seekers arriving in Greece and Italy across the bloc has proved difficult to implement, with less than 7,300 transferred from Italy - out of an overall target of 35,000 - with some Eastern European countries refusing to take in any of the migrants. Opposing coalitions of member states mean that discussions on reforming the EU's dysfunctional asylum system have stalled, with no agreement on the right balance between what the EU refers to as \"responsibility\" (to assess asylum claims in the first European country migrants enter) and \"solidarity\" (redistributing the asylum seekers). Policymakers in Brussels grumble that the men, women and children arriving in Italy are not \"real\" refugees, but economic migrants - despite the fact that 43% of them are being granted protection on asylum or humanitarian grounds. Shifting the burden of overcoming the political stalemate at EU level onto the NGOs is not the solution, nor is the one line of action which EU states currently agree on - outsourcing efforts to curb migration flows to Europe to the likes of Libya, Niger or, further afield, the regime in Sudan. Proponents of the so-called \"externalisation\" of EU migration and asylum policies to non-European countries are oblivious to human rights concerns, regarding the horrific treatment of migrants in Libya or the loss of lives in the Nigerien desert as smugglers resort to alternative routes to avoid detection. What they do seek, however, are quick-impact fixes which reduce migrant arrivals in Europe. Given that these efforts have not paid off so far, they argue, stopping rescue NGOs from operating will discourage migrants from trying to cross the Mediterranean - a line based on the unproven assumption that the NGOs, like the Italian navy's Mare Nostrum operation in 2014, are acting as a \"pull factor\". Will hundreds more need to perish, as they did after Mare Nostrum ceased to operate, to prove them wrong?

NATO head Jens Stoltenberg unveiled the new project, to be called operation Sea Guardian, on the last day of a summit in Warsaw on Saturday (9 July). \"We have decided to transform operation Active Endeavour into a broader security mission called Sea Guardian\", he said. \"We intend to work closely with the European Union's operation Sophia in the central Mediterranean, building on our swift and effective cooperation with the EU to cut lines of international human trafficking in the Aegean\", he said. Speaking more broadly about the terrorist threat to Europe and the migration crisis, he added: \"The scale of the task requires that we undertake joint efforts\". Active Endeavour is an old NATO mission that was launched after 9/11 to protect shipping in the Straits of Gibraltar from terrorist attacks. Sophia is an EU naval mission, launched last year, designed to stem the flow of migrants from Libya to Italy. Stoltenberg's mention of the Aegean refers to NATO's decision, in February, to send seven warships to help stop migrant boats going from Turkey to Greece. Sea Guardian NATO officials said it was too early to publish details on when Sea Guardian would start work, what kind of assets it would have, and what it would do. But according to NATO literature, Active Endeavour was composed of Greek, Italian, Spanish and Turkish warships as well as Danish, German and Norwegian patrol boats. The Western alliance, outside the summit venue in Warsaw, put on display one of the five Global Hawk drones that it bought from US firm Northrop Grumman and that are designed to start operations at the Sigonella air base in Italy in 2017. They fly at high altitudes for up to 30 hours, covering areas larger than 100,000 square km, and give almost real-time images. A NATO source told EUobserver they would \"very likely\" play a role in Sea Guardian. Comments reflect the opinions of the visitor and not those of Libyan Express, its editorial board or staff.

Earlier this week, a Libyan Coast Guard vessel approached another NGO ship -- the Golfo Azzurro, operated by Proactiva Open Arms -- and fired warning shots at it. The crew say they were told: \"We have been watching you for the last two days. You are carrying out suspicious activities, we have confirmation that you have dealings with human traffickers, do not come back to our waters.\" The Libyans supposedly added: \"Never come back, otherwise we will shoot you.\" Back in February 2017, the EU Border Agency (Frontex) described NGOs in the Mediterranean as acting \"like taxis\" for illegal migrants, having determined that their operations off Libya helped people-smugglers to \"achieve their objectives at minimum cost [and] strengthen their business model by increasing the chances of success\". Consequently, their \"rescue\" missions were encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing to Europe and, perversely, increasing total drowning deaths. The Frontex analysis was soon followed by several accusations of direct collusion between NGOs and people-smugglers, with the Italian authorities impounding the ship Iuventa after photographic evidence appeared to show it accepting transfers of Europe-bound migrants from smuggler boats directly. EUROPEAN NGOs are acting as taxi service for human traffickers by transporting illegal alien Muslim invaders from just off the coast of Libya to Italy. George Soros has given USD $500 million to fund these NGOs in order to flood Europe with as many Muslim freeloaders, rapists, and jihadists as possible. Just 2.65% of invaders to Italy are real refugees and only about 10% of that number are Syrian refugees. GEFIRA Human traffickers contact the Italian coast guard in advance to receive support and to pick up their dubious human cargo. NGO ships are directed to the \"rescue spot\" even as those to be rescued are still in Libya. The organizations behind this are: MOAS, Jugend Rettet, Stichting Bootvluchting, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Save the Children, Proactiva Open Arms, Sea-Watch.org, Sea-Eye and Life Boat. Brussels has created particular legislature to protect people traffickers against prosecution. Most of these illegals are not eligible for being granted asylum and will end up on the streets of Rome or Paris or Berlin and undermine Europe's stability raising racially motivated social tensions. In just w months, at least 39 000 African Muslims were illegally smuggled into Italy, which was done with the full consent of the Italian and European authorities. syus Despite the urgings of former Australian premier Tony Abbott to adopt his own country's tough love 'Stop the Boats' strategy -- which sees would-be migrants turned back at sea or processed off-shore and settled in third countries, thus slashing attempted journeys and the accompanying drownings to near zero -- for a long time nothing was done. However, the recent impounding of the Iuventa and the Libyan security forces' stern instructions to NGOs -- coupled with the commencement of direct action by Italian warships within Libyan waters -- may represent a gamechanging development in the region.

And about damned time!!!!!!! Reply Linda Rivera says August 12, 2017 at 7:32 pm WONDERFUL Words to the WICKED NGO TRAITORS: Libya told them \"Never come back, or we will shoot you.\" They should have shot every one of them. It's Immigration Jihad ordered by the Quran Book of WAR Aided and Abetted by BLOODTHIRSTY Satanist George Soros and the BLOODTHIRSTY SATANIC EU BEAST who Crave the Mass Barbaric Murder of our people. There are now so many Muslims in Europe and Britain (Muslims are the majority in London) that if no more Muslims infiltrated, Muslims will become the majority in Britain and Europe within years. If Muslims are not massively deported now, Britain and Europe's non-Muslims will suffer terror and horror far worse than their worst nightmares. British and European leaders have guaranteed that civil war will rage throughout out nations. RIVERS of BLOOD will run in our streets as warned by Britain's patriotic Enoch Powell. Form highly organised, highly trained civilian defense groups immediately!!!

GEFIRA Human traffickers contact the Italian coast guard in advance to receive support and to pick up their dubious human cargo. NGO ships are directed to the \"rescue spot\" even as those to be rescued are still in Libya. The organizations behind this are: MOAS, Jugend Rettet, Stichting Bootvluchting, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Save the Children, Proactiva Open Arms, Sea-Watch.org, Sea-Eye and Life Boat. Brussels has created particular legislature to protect people traffickers against prosecution. Most of these illegals are not eligible for being granted asylum and will end up on the streets of Rome or Paris or Berlin and undermine Europe's stability raising racially motivated social tensions. In just w months, at least 39 000 African Muslims were illegally smuggled into Italy, which was done with the full consent of the Italian and European authorities. There is a full account about the ships involved: \"NGOs Armada operating off the coast of Libya\"and how people are encourage to come to Europe: \"Death road to Europe promoted on the web\" The w2eu.info website with its subheading that reads 'independent information for refugees and migrants coming to Europe' tells about itself that it intends to support the migrants' efforts because 'freedom of movement is everybody's right.' Its activists who are located in different EU countries claim they do their work free of charge. The same website provides leaflets, instructions and 'visit cards' to be printed in such languages as English, French, Arabic, Farsi (or Persian, spoken in Iran and Afghanistan), Pashto (one of the two official languages in Afghanistan), Tigrinya (spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea) and Somali. The migrants are told in no uncertain terms what they must say in order to be granted asylum, which is granted because of prosecution for race, religion, nationality, membership of a social or political group. The migrant is also encouraged to report any violation of his rights.

Reply Veka Fitzfrancis says December 6, 2016 at 5:50 pm Bonnie, while I have no doubt that NGOs are smuggling people in, I've worked with MSN (Doctors Without Borders) and they are very clear in their charter about what they can do - transporting people is a huge no go.

Safe from all FEAR and TERROR, our leaders are laughing at us. This is the suffering our leaders want for all our people and nations: French lady speaker: There are 18,000 migrants in the jungle. The police cannot enter. It is prohibited. Every day, every night, there are riots. They bash cars with iron bars. They attack people. They even attack children. There are rapes. There are thefts. They come to the town centre by 2,000-3,000-4,000 everywhere. They bash cars with iron bars. They enter private houses when the people are at home. They want to eat. Sometimes they bash the people, stealing what they can. What they cannot take, they destroy. My son was attacked by 3 illegals. He took a big blow to the face with an iron bar. 30 migrants came to massacre him. He fled. They take the school buses with the children. The more one gives them, the more they demand. It is: \"Give me the mobile\". If you don't give it to them, you get beaten. The government has abandoned us. A demo was held against the massive invasion. At the protest, French General Piquemal, a French icon, was arrested, manhandled and pushed to the ground by a policeman who put his foot on his neck. He was dragged away. The other French protesters were arrested and jailed. The illegals come into town armed with iron bars and molotov cocktails. I have seen the police retreat before the migrants. This made me cry because that's not normal. We are in our home, we are in our country, we are in our town. The riot police should rather order the migrants to step back and not the reverse. They demonstrate because they want 2,000 euros pocket money per month. They want a car and also a house. The French have to be crushed, they have to be evicted. One has to take everything from them to leave the space to the rabble who want to colonise us. Resident of Calais speaks. This is the death of civilization. Reply Linda Rivera says December 5, 2016 at 7:31 pm The EVIL deeds of TRAITORS are recorded in Heavenly Books that will be opened on the Day of Judgement. Muslim migrant: \"We will multiply our numbers. We must have more children than the Christians because it's the only way we can destroy them here'.\" Muslims have been massively imported into Britain and Europe by wicked ruling elites to Annihilate Christians. Muslims share the same TERRIFYING HATE for Christians as our leaders. Population Replacement is FORBIDDEN by international law. Anti-God, British and European Christian-hater leaders are International Lawbreakers who colonised our nations with Muslims to replace Europe's white Christians with Muslims. https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2206253/refugee-camp-translator-german-migrants-despise-christians-islamise-country/ SIMMERING HATRED Refugee camp translator reveals how German migrants 'despise' Christians and want to 'Islamise' the country. Eritrean woman, 39, who worked in asylum centres for five years, claims women told her they were having as many kids as possible to 'destroy' Germany. 17th November 2016. A TRANSLATOR at refugee camps in Germany has claimed Muslim migrants hate Christians and want to Islamise the country. The woman, 39, from Eritrea, came to Germany as a refugee herself in 1991, before volunteering at asylum centres to \"give something back\". But the Arabic speaker said what she discovered when working with migrants over the last five years shocked her. During her time at a number of centres across the country, she said she discovered Muslim refugees preaching \"pure hatred\" of Christians. Muslim children were told by their parents not to play with Christian kids. And she herself was told it was a sin for her to help feed and defend Christians. She told German Catholic website Kath.net: \"They want Germany to be Islamised. They despise our country and our values.\" She claimed many of the migrants showed their \"true colours\" only when they were away from people of other religions. The translator explained: \"Pure hatred against non-believers is preached, and children are brought here from an early age here in Germany. \"It's very similar in asylum housing, where Muslim boys refuse to play with Christians. \"Some women told me 'We will multiply our numbers. We must have more children than the Christians because it's the only way we can destroy them here'.\" She said other translators were a part of the problem, claiming they prevented Christian refugees claiming permanent asylum by failing to tell them they were entitled to have their questionnaire's translated. Reply Az gal says December 5, 2016 at 4:32 pm I guess a lot of Europeans are Ok with working to support these hundreds of thousands of young, healthy, uneducated Muslim men. Europe has quite a yoke around its neck. I wonder at what point they will cry, \"Enough!\" Probably not until their population has been effectively replaced. Reply A Harris USA says December 5, 2016 at 4:29 pm Seems to me that Europe may be coming together to counter the Islamic invasion . The nationalist are making some strides into the fight against the invasion. If they will take the bull by the horns and unseat the left wing wackos and immigration loving libs, and demand they deport these pigs, there is a chance that they will get their nations back.. They must act fast!!! The left wing will worry about a Euro Trump and start doubling up on the flood of Muslims!! Making it almost impossible to reverse the flow.. GET YOUR TRUMP ON EUROPE, NOW!!! Reply davidrasch says December 5, 2016 at 4:26 pm I continue to think this is an 'oil for refugees' deal regardless of the front people/organizations.

The GLOBS are close to achieving their long desired totalitarian, elitist dreams. Forcing a cashless society will finish their takeover. Reply American Templar says December 5, 2016 at 2:48 pm I think if Trump can expose the true perpatrators of this muslim invasion migrant scam and also punish them for treason or bribery with real prison time and not a wrist slap then other countries will get emboldened to follow suit. Someone, somewhere is getting something out of this hoax and lie. Let's find out who and what then deal with them for the damage they caused.

(Photo: EEAS) By Eszter Zalan BRUSSELS, 1. Aug 2017, 09:25 Five aid groups have refused to sign Italy's code of conduct for organisations that run migrant rescue ships in the Mediterranean, the Italian interior ministry said on Monday (31 July). Three other organisations backed the new rules, which include a ban on sending light signals that may help migrants and a ban on transferring migrants to other ships.

Watch our founder Lisbeth Kirk explain the reasons in this 30 seconds video. One of the organisations that refused to sign the code of conduct, Doctors Without Borders (MSF), said in a letter on Monday that they already respected several provisions, such as financial transparency. MSF said that the code of conduct could lead to a decrease in the efficiency and capacity of the search and rescue response in the Mediterranean, leading to more deaths. \"Proposals - in particular the one stating that vessels engaged in rescue must disembark survivors to a place of safety as a rule instead of transferring to other ships - present unnecessary limitations to the means at our disposal today,\" said the organisation, which noted that it had saved 16,000 people. \"A reduction in the number of rescue vessels would weaken an already insufficient search and rescue capacity, resulting in an increase in mass drownings,\" MSF warned, adding that it observes all the maritime and international rules. Save the Children did sign up to the code of conduct, saying that it already complied with most of the rules. The Malta-based Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) and Spanish group Proactiva Open Arms also agreed to the code, while Germany's Sea-Watch, Sea-Eye and Jugend Rettet, and France's SOS Mediterranee abstained. One of the issues they were concerned with was the obligation to accept police officers on board their vessels, which some organisations say interferes with the humanitarian principle of neutrality. Italy argues the officers are needed to root out traffickers hiding among migrants. The Italian ministry said that all the organisations not participating in the scheme will be outside the \"organised system of sea rescue\", and will face \"all the consequences\", without going into details. This year, 95,000 people arrived at Italy's coast, and more than 2,378 people died on the journey in the Mediterranean, according to UN data. In the first six months of this year, more than 30 percent of all rescue operations were carried out by NGOs. Rome is concerned that the presence of NGOs encourages smugglers and migrants to embark on the perilous journey. Italy had previously threatened to shut its ports to NGOs that did not sign up to the code of conduct. Rome has also secured the backing of the the EU for the new rules. The European Commission has said the code would aim to better coordinate rescues at sea. The 12-point code includes a ban on crossing into Libyan territorial waters and calls for cooperation with the police to investigate human trafficking. But while NGO boats will be banned from Libyan waters, the Italian navy is getting ready to enter them. Last week, Italy's government agreed to send naval support to Libyan waters after a request was submitted by the UN-backed government in Tripoli, in its battle against people smugglers. Rome's efforts to curb the NGOs' activities at sea have also been fuelled by an increasingly widespread perception that the organisations are aiding smugglers, something the aid groups have repeatedly denied. Aside from human rights groups, the UN's children's agency, Unicef, has also condemned Italy's code of conduct. It said earlier this month that the new rules put children's lives at risk.

The proposal states that it is consistent with other EU policies in relation to migration, specifically: Prevention of and countering of migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings, Return of illegally staying third-country nationals, Integrated Border Management, Legal migration and Integration, External relations policy of the Union and Data protection. The proposal document also claims to have consulted in regards to this policy with stakeholders, primarily Immigration Liaison Officers and their managers, as well as national authorities in Member States and international organisations such as the International Organization for Migration and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In regards to the actual creation of the network, the proposal states \"This Regulation lays down rules to improve the coordination of immigration liaison officers deployed to third countries by Member States, the Commission and the Union Agencies through the creation of a European network of immigration liaison officers.\" It also proposes the creation of a Steering Board made up of one representative of each Member State, two representatives of the Commission, one representative of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, one representative of Europol and one representative of European Union Asylum Agency, with a Commission representative acting as Chair of the Steering Board. The Steering Board will also work with Immigration Liaison Officers to create a secure system for exchanging relevant information and statistics. To assess progress, the following indicators have been proposed: Number of joint analytical products delivered by networks of ILOs Number of joint deployment of ILOs co-financed from the EU budget Improved sharing of information between ILOs' networks and EU Agencies The proposal comes in light of the EU's Progress report on migration and their factsheet on Crisis Management Tools. The report calls for additional financial investment from both Member States and the EU in order to support EU action on the external dimensions of migration. The report summarises the situation on migration roots and EU support for managing migration. Specifically in regards to education, the EU has been maintaining support for the Facility for Refugees in Turkey, which provides education and healthcare for hundreds of thousands of refugees and EUR 1 Billion of funding allocated to Syria and Jordan to improve healthcare and education provision amongst Syrian refugees. As affirmed in previous statements, ETUCE is committed to promoting education as a right for all, including migrants and refugees. The EU and Member States must continue investment in educational provision for migrants and refugees as part of the European Agenda on Migration to ensure that, as so often happens, migrant and refugee children are not left out of education systems without access.

Merkel legt aan Trump haar versie van de Vluchtelingenconventie van Geneve uit 29 januari 2017dutchdl Een reactie plaatsen E.J. Bron (Door: \"Victoria\" - Vertaling: E.J. Bron) Merkel bekritiseert Trump's inreisverbod voor moslims en legt aan hem de Vluchtelingenconventie van Geneve uit, echter volgens haar versie. Mevrouw Merkel wil iets uitleggen wat zij blijkbaar zelf niet begrepen heeft. De bondskanselier, die blijkbaar verkondigde dat grenzen de \"vluchtelingen\" niet kunnen stoppen, die geen bovengrens accepteert en met haar vluchtelingenpolitiek voor een controleverlies van de binnenlandse veiligheid en organen van de autoriteiten had gezorgd, geeft dus goede raad.

Bron (Door: Steffen Munter - Vertaling: E.J. Bron) Nadat de nieuwe Amerikaanse president Donald Trump vandaag een ontmoeting had met de Britse premier Theresa May, zal hij morgen bellen met de Russische president Vladimir Poetin en de Duitse bondskanselier Angela Merkel. We kunnen waarschijnlijk rekenen op interessante resultaten. Trump laat geen vermoeidheidsverschijnselen zien bij de invoering van zijn verkiezingsbeloftes en andere plannen.

Bron (Door: Joost Niemoller) De Volkskrant bracht het nieuws dat er een intern EU-stuk op tafel zou liggen om Libie af te sluiten, zodat de migratiestroom vanuit Afrika naar Europa afgesloten zou worden. De EU zou geld willen geven aan Libie, zodat die de grens kunnen afsluiten. Andere Mainstream media namen dit bericht snel over. De achterliggende gedachte zou de angst voor de opkomst van de 'populisten' zijn. Maar al even eerder verscheen in de internationale pers het bericht https://euobserver.com/migration/136656dat er binnen de Europese Commissie veel weerstand zou zijn tegen deze mogelijke herhaling van de Turkije deal.

Nov 2017, 15:35 An EU monitoring system to ensure the Libyan coastguard treat rescued migrants with dignity is broadly run by the Libyans themselves. The system is supposed to prevent EU-trained Libyans from abusing people rescued from within their territorial waters.

Watch our founder Lisbeth Kirk explain the reasons in this 30 seconds video. A European Commission spokeswoman told reporters last week that they have yet to receive any reports of abuse - despite video evidence collected by charity NGO boats that suggests otherwise. \"If any kind of violence was to be noticed, we would obviously condemn it,\" said the spokeswoman. The EU's Mediterranean flotilla Operation Sophia has trained some 142 Libyan coastguards. The same coastguard intercepted over 19,000 people trying to cross the Mediterranean since the start of the year. Those rescued end up in militia-run detention centres where they can face abuse, rape, slavery, or even death. Libyans draft reports A monitoring mechanism in July was set up to make sure the Libyan coastguard adhere to human rights as part of the EU-run training exercise. But in practice, it means getting the Libyans to draft reports about themselves. On the EU side, it means sending experts from Operation Sophia to Tripoli to assess the monitoring but only \"when conditions on the ground allow for it\". Operation Sophia is not embedded on the Libyan boats and provides no operational direction or assistance when it comes to human rights. The EU Commission's comments follow sharp condemnation of the EU training policy of the Libyan coastguard by the UN human rights commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein. Hussein last week also said the EU and Italy are helping the Libyan coastguard intercept people in international waters. People plucked from international waters cannot legally be returned to Libya. Hussein said the EU and its member states involvement in the training \"has done nothing so far to reduce the level of abuses suffered by migrants\". Italy goes to court The EU has set aside some EUR46 million to help train and equip the Libyan coastguard. That money is overseen by the Italian ministry of interior. But the Italian-based Association for Juridical Studies on Immigration (Asgi) is now taking the Italian ministry of foreign affairs to court. Asgi announced its decision last week and wants to hold the Italian government accountable for the living conditions of migrants stranded in Libya. \"We believe it is necessary to question the policies implemented by the Italian and European authorities, which directly and indirectly finance the Libyan authorities, strengthen them with equipment and instruments,\" said the law makers, in a statement. The EU Commission says the EU money spent in Libya is being monitored by the Italian ministry of interior. It also says that they intend to contract a third party to the independently monitor the activities on the ground. \"As an extra layer of control, the surveillance of the activities may be reinforced through an ad-hoc monitoring,\" it says.

The migrants have been blocked at the Sicilian port of Catania on the Diciotti vessel since Monday night because the Italian government is refusing to allow them to disembark without commitments from the EU to take some of them in. A meeting of high-level representatives from around a dozen EU member states is due to be held on Friday to discuss the issue, according to the Commission. \"In recent months we have had the chance to see how a soft line with the European Union worked and how a hard line works,\" Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said in an interview published on Facebook on Thursday. \"If tomorrow (Friday) nothing comes out of the European Commission meeting, if they decide nothing regarding the Diciotti and the redistribution of the migrants, I and the whole Five Star Movement will no longer be prepared to give 20 billion euros ($23 billion) to the European Union every year.\" EU figures for 2016 say Italy contributed just under 14 billion euros to the EU budget -- less than one percent of its gross national income -- while the bloc spent 11.6 billion euros in Italy. Di Maio, who heads the anti-establishment Five Star, said Italy didn't want the \"mickey taken out of us by the union's other countries\" on the distribution of migrants. \"The EU was born of principles like solidarity. If it is not capable of redistributing 170 people it has serious problems with its founding principles,\" he said in an interview with state broadcaster RAI. Friday's meeting follows Interior Minister Matteo Salvini's decision to leave the majority of the migrants on board the Diciotti after they were rescued on August 15. His only concession has been to allow 27 unaccompanied minors off the boat Wednesday.

Cette proposition stipule que, en vertu des autres politiques en matiere de migration, les elements ci-apres s'averent coherents : prevention et elimination du trafic et de l'entree clandestine des etres humains, renvoi des ressortissant(e)s nationaux des pays tiers en situation illegale, gestion integree des frontieres, migration legale et integration, politiques de l'UE en matiere de relations exterieures et protection des donnees. La proposition declare egalement que, s'agissant de cette politique, des consultations ont ete menees aupres des parties engagees, principalement les officiers de liaison et leurs superieurs, ainsi qu'aupres des autorites nationales des Etats membres et de diverses organisations internationales telles que l'Organisation internationale de la migration et le Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les refugie(e)s. Concernant la creation du reseau, la proposition souligne que ce reglement definit les principes de base pour l'amelioration de la coordination des officiers de liaison << immigration >> deployes dans les pays tiers par les Etats membres, la Commission et les agences de l'Union, au travers de la creation d'un reseau europeen des officiers de liaison << immigration >>. Il est egalement propose de creer un Comite directeur reunissant un(e) representant(e) de chaque Etat membre, deux representant(e)s de la Commission, un(e) representant(e) de l'Agence europeenne de garde-frontieres et de garde-cotes, un(e) representant(e) d'Europol et un(e) representant(e) du Bureau europeen d'appui en matiere d'asile - dont la presidence serait confiee a un(e) representant(e) de la Commission. Ce Comite directeur travaillerait egalement avec les officiers de liaison << immigration >> en vue de creer un systeme securise pour l'echange d'informations et de statistiques pertinentes. Afin d'evaluer les avancees, les indicateurs suivants ont ete proposes : Nombre d'outils d'analyses conjoints offerts par les reseaux OLI Nombre de deploiements conjoints des OLI cofinances par le budget de l'UE Amelioration du partage d'informations entre les reseaux OLI et les agences de l'UE Cette proposition intervient dans le cadre du rapport d'avancement de l'UE sur la migration et des fiches d'information sur les outils de gestion de la crise. Le rapport appelle a un investissement financier supplementaire de la part des Etats membres et de l'UE, afin de soutenir les actions de cette derniere portant sur les dimensions exterieures de la migration. Le rapport presente un resume de la situation de la migration et de ses causes, et decrit le soutien apporte par l'UE pour en assurer la gestion. Dans le cas plus specifique de l'education, l'UE a maintenu son soutien dans le cadre de son programme << Facilite de l'UE en faveur des refugies en Turquie >>, prevoyant des services d'education et de soins de sante pour plusieurs centaines de milliers de refugie(e)s, ainsi qu'un financement de 1 milliard EUR alloue a la Syrie et a la Jordanie pour ameliorer ces services au sein de la population des refugie(e)s syrien(ne)s. Comme annonce dans les declarations precedentes, le CSEE s'engage a promouvoir l'education en tant que droit universel, y compris pour les migrant(e)s et les refugie(e)s. L'UE et ses Etats membres doivent poursuivre leurs investissements dans les services d'education destines aux migrant(e)s et aux refugie(e)s dans le cadre de l'Agenda europeen en matiere de migration, afin de garantir que les enfants migrants et refugies ne soient pas tenus a l'ecart des systemes d'education, comme c'est si souvent le cas.

(Sorry, that horse has already left the barn) Breitbart His comments come in response to an official report warning that many of Britain's towns and cities have been transformed \"out of all recognition\" into NO GO ZONES for non-Muslims, the direct result of mass Muslim immigration. David Cameron also had this idea which is why he no longer is in office The report, by the government's community cohesion tsar Dame Louise Casey, warned that parts of British towns had been turned into ghettoes which successive governments have ignored \"for fear of being branded racist or Islamophobic\", and which are creating \"escalating divisions and tensions\". But Miqdaad Versi, assistant secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain, has struck back, writing for The Guardian that Casey is wrong to blame Muslim communities. Instead, he said white flight and economic inequality were greater problems - and that white people ought to do more to tackle them. He added: \"Worryingly, Casey often conflates Muslim with Asian communities, giving the false impression that all regressive cultural practices are based on the Islamic faith despite clear evidence to the contrary. While the report does recognise the huge levels of socio-economic deprivation, low educational attainment and discrimination some Muslims face, none of her recommendations tackle structural inequality.\" He asks: \"Why does Casey say so little on how to tackle the fact that white British and Irish ethnic groups 'are least likely to have ethnically mixed social networks' - one of the key signs of integration. \"And why is there so little discussion about what to do about 'white flight' from the inner cities as one of the drivers of further segregation.\" (It's easy to stop white flight...get rid of the Muslims) Versi argues that more should be done to highlight the \"extensive and positive contribution of migrants\", insisting that the focus on \"migrant communities, and those of Muslims in particular\" - not the actions of those Muslims themselves - are the \"real barriers to integration\". He slams Casey in particular for \"sensationalising\" the rise in the number of British mosques (Casey says their growth in recent years has been \"exponential\"), while \"underplaying the growth of the far right\". Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More... That's because dogs are offensive to muslims And he criticises her for apparently claiming that \"Christmas is a problem for Muslim communities\". However, although Casey did criticise local councils for \"over worrying\" about causing offence to minority groups through the celebration of Christmas, during a speech to council leaders, the issue doesn't appear in her final report. Casey made it clear during her speech that such attitudes among council staff led directly to the abuse suffered by 1,400 girls in Rotherham. \"The council and police were in denial about what was happening in their town,\" Casey said in her speech. \"That was a tragic failure on so many levels, not least for the victims who weren't heard or whose abuse could have been prevented.\" Versi isn't the only prominent Muslim to have slammed the report. Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation think-tank, condemned it as \"inflammatory, divisive, pandering to the agenda of the far-Right\". He said: \"We are saddened that once again British Muslims have become a political football which is bashed from time to time without any regard for the impact this has on individuals who are then subjected to threats and violence.\" Then, of course, you have the government \"genius\" who thought this one up: View image on Twitter Follow Breitbart London @BreitbartLondon Make Mosques Look More British to Help Muslims Integrate, Says Government Report http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/12/06/mosques-look-british-help-muslims-integrate-says-government-report/ ... 2:15 PM - 6 Dec 2016 7676 Retweets 4242 likes Posted in Islamic wave, islamisation | Leave a comment And this Muslim in a supremacist headbag wonders why not nobody jumped to her aid when 3 drunk Trump supporters verbally taunted her on a NYC subway train Posted on December 7, 2016 by jazzy800 Three 'white' men who were apparently intoxicated, allegedly chanted \"Donald Trump\" and other anti-Islam insults at a Muslim student in the subway, but nobody tried to help.

GEFIRA Human traffickers contact the Italian coast guard in advance to receive support and to pick up their dubious human cargo. NGO ships are directed to the \"rescue spot\" even as those to be rescued are still in Libya. The organizations behind this are: MOAS, Jugend Rettet, Stichting Bootvluchting, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Save the Children, Proactiva Open Arms, Sea-Watch.org, Sea-Eye and Life Boat. Brussels has created particular legislature to protect people traffickers against prosecution. Most of these illegals are not eligible for being granted asylum and will end up on the streets of Rome or Paris or Berlin and undermine Europe's stability raising racially motivated social tensions. In just w months, at least 39 000 African Muslims were illegally smuggled into Italy, which was done with the full consent of the Italian and European authorities. Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More... There is a full account about the ships involved: \"NGOs Armada operating off the coast of Libya\"and how people are encourage to come to Europe: \"Death road to Europe promoted on the web\" The w2eu.info website with its subheading that reads 'independent information for refugees and migrants coming to Europe' tells about itself that it intends to support the migrants' efforts because 'freedom of movement is everybody's right.' Its activists who are located in different EU countries claim they do their work free of charge. The same website provides leaflets, instructions and 'visit cards' to be printed in such languages as English, French, Arabic, Farsi (or Persian, spoken in Iran and Afghanistan), Pashto (one of the two official languages in Afghanistan), Tigrinya (spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea) and Somali. The migrants are told in no uncertain terms what they must say in order to be granted asylum, which is granted because of prosecution for race, religion, nationality, membership of a social or political group. The migrant is also encouraged to report any violation of his rights.

Idverzet The group draped anti-Islam banners from the roof of the Tuhid Mosque which said \"Islamists Not Welcome,\" \"No Mosque in Our Neighborhood,\" and \"No Jihad in the Street.\" On the minaret they have hoisted the Identitarian 'Lamda' flag. The police were present soon, but it took half past three until our roof activists were taken and taken to the police station. Diyanet is an institution that also manages various mosques in the Netherlands and falls directly under Erdogan. All named imams are for example Turkish officials.It is known that the sermons are drawn up in Turkey and are aimed at influencing the Turkish population here. Thus, in the mosques in the Netherlands, Gu len was called on to betray the adherents to the Turkish government. We see the presence of Diyanet mosques as a direct influence of Dutch society. We therefore urge the Dutch government to take steps against the so-called espionage mosques that fall under Diyanet. And if they do not do that, we only have to put up on follow-up actions. Identitair Verzet works in conjunction with the 'Defend Europe' group using boats to stop the flood of illegal Muslim refugees being brought into Europe from Libya. Idverzet Every day, hundreds of economic immigrants make the crossing of Libya to European territory. They are helped by Non Government Organizations (NGOs), such as Physicians Without Borders, who pick up them up to 50 kilometers from the Libyan coastline to transfer them 600 miles further to Europe. These organizations work together with illegal smugglers who promise African illegal invaders a safe crossing to the best welfare havens in Europe. The Identity Movement is confronting the mess that EU is causing. We identify organizations that enable this illegal human trafficking through the Mediterranean: Non Government Organizations, such as Stichting Bootvluchtteling , Sea Watch , Physicians Without Borders and Sea Eye Shipowners that make ships available to NGOs, such as Vroon in Breda These organizations are not only guilty of human trafficking, they violate international maritime law and European treaties. Any support for a crossing of economic invaders through the Mediterranean is illegal. Identitarian Resistance Vienna delivered a spectacular show in the inner city of Vienna that featured the mock decapitation of the left-wing \"Refugee Welcome\" supporters. ejbron The scene targeted the bleeding hearts of the Left-wing Refugee Welcome gang, who personally meet and greet the illegal alien Muslim rapists and jihadists at the docks. They are shown holding their 'Refugee Welcome' signs as members of the Austrian Identitarian Resistance posing as ISIS jihadists grabbed them from behind and pretended to cut their heads off. Shouts of \"We will continue until our country is secured,\" were heard as well as vows to secure the borders and keep the country free of Muslim illegal alien invaders posing as refugees. The small but willful and determined group of Identitarian Resistance in Austria regularly performs provocative but effective actions. They protest the politics of open borders, and Austrian chancellor Faymann hanging onto Merkel's coattails. And while the folks on the Left chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here,\" Sellner demanded through the loudspeaker: \"Fortress Europe! Close the boundaries!\" Share this newsClick to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Filed Under: Muslim Invaders Loading...

While it may be disheartening to see some trying to interfere with their portrayal of the real izlam, I noticed a lot of people were taking in the performance and this may start to germinate ideas of what civilized and uncivilized belief systems are. Maybe we can hold a faint glimmer of hope. Reply Polish says September 4, 2017 at 6:45 am Kill pig on the construction site. Than ground will be unholy. They will stop building mosque. Simple. Every police officer should have bullets washed in pigs blood. No terrorist attacks any more. Reply Az gal says September 4, 2017 at 6:43 am I love it! Yay to the Identitarians! Cutting leftist heads off- brilliant! Unfortunately they had to keep fighting off Muzzwarts & leftists trying to destroy their demo. I guess no one here in US wants to demonstrate a mosque construction & get a criminal record. Reply Christine t says September 4, 2017 at 4:36 am Its unbelievable that theyre importing this garbage. What sane person invites hordes of criminal savages that have no intention of working. Europeans havent even got jobs and housing for their own children, they must really hate their children and grandchildren, theyre destroying their future Reply Hartmut says September 4, 2017 at 3:42 am Wishing the best of support and success for these people. Reply Linda Rivera says September 3, 2017 at 7:14 pm Our young people are Magnificent and Outstanding role models for all ages. They're very different from weak minded, girly male, feeble spirited leftists who are digging our graves in all non-Muslim countries. I despise these COWARDS with every fiber of my being. They proudly brag about the fact that they're not racist and do nothing about seeking to protect our women and children from Muslim sexual terrorists. \"Fortress Europe!

Reply El Cid says September 3, 2017 at 6:13 pm The jihadist Mohammedans obeying the commands of the Koran,inflicted terror again,this time on Barcelona Spain in 8/17! After reading the valid Medina part of the Koran ( recitation)that abrogated the older pious Mecca part,Sira ( biography of Muhammad)and Hadith ( tradition of Muhammad),the three \" Holy\" books of Islam( Submission) and reviewing the >1400 year criminal record of Islam ( it destroyed many civilizations and killed >270 mil in Asia, Africa and Europe),it is clear Islam is a militant ,totalitarian, misogynistic ,POLITICAL IDEOLOGY (islamofascism)of desert arab male supremacy (>80%) ,DISGUISED AS A RELIGION( < 20%) ,based on a distorted Bible, that fights by jihad and soft cultural jihad to subjugate the World .As a political ideology it must and will be criticized daily. More specifically: 1-Muhammad in the Koran considers WOMEN dumb, inferior to males,wives must be beaten for disobedience, all women will go to Hell unless their husbands will say in the Last Day ,that they were pleased with them and women must not show their face ,curves or skin (and wear Burkas ),so men will not be tempted ! 2-APOSTATES from Islam,BLASPHEMERS, ADULTERERS, HYPOCRITES must be killed ,as commanded by the koran! 3-The Koran says muslims( faithful) must never be friends with KAFR-INFIDELS , for they may tempt them to stray from the right path and instead to kill them ,if they refuse to become muslims or pay the jizya submission tax in humiliation.The koran therefore teaches hate!Muslims must pray five times a day cursing the infidels.( Google: muslim prayer translation). 4-Islam in Sira and Hadith commands all muslims to continuous JIHAD ,war against the kafr-infidels ,until they are all subjugated, promising ,if killed as jihadists,entry straight into paradise regardless of their sins ,along with 70 of their relatives,and sex to eternity with 72 recurrent virgins ! 5-\"PROPHET\"MUHAMMAD is the perfect man for muslims to emulate and revere, even though in Sira and Hadith many eye witnesses state he was a pedophile( wife Aisha was 9 yo),mass murderer,torturer,rapist,liar,bandit and sex slave trader. Therefore: Allow no muslim immigrants ,the way communists were banned. Deport the muslims ,especially those on watch lists or relatives of jihadists.Muslim immigration is Hejira .This along with forced child marriages ,multiple wives( Bin Laden had 16 children and 52 siblings)will replace the local population ,will destroy and replace the identity and culture of each country and impose barbaric islamic monoculturism world wide.Muslim refugees should go to vast rich Saudi Arabia ,until they can return to their countries. Denounce islamic Sharia (way)law of misogyny,child brides,burkas, halal meat from tortured animals certified bypaid imams,clitorectomies,segregation of women,banning of short skirts,dancing,singing,dogs,pork,alcohol,beauty contests and blasphemy laws. Avoid trade with muslim countries ,that practice Sharia and support jihad.Demand gender equality for ALL muslim women.Punish severely those that kill apostates from Islam,blasphemers,adulterers or hypocrites. Teach in schools , have in libraries, read in Google and condemn often the valid cruel medina part of the Koran, Sira and Hadith ,so everybody will know the evil of Islam.No appeasement or accommodations to muslims.Islam is incompatible with our freedom of speech,gender equality,values,way of life,Human Rights,Constitution, Republic and population stability needed to sustain Life on Earth. We defeated in bloody WW II German Nazism( National SOCIALISM )that killed more than 15 mill in their extermination camps),Japanese Shintoism ,that slaughtered millions in occupied China ,isolated USSR Communism ,that killed millions in Ukraine and in Gulag camps in Siberia,until it collapsed in 1989 , helped Communist China adopt State Capitalism for its benefit and the World's and now its time all of us 6 billion Kafr-infidels ,past, present and future victims of Islam to unite and defeat the tyranny of Islamofascism.

Jul 2016, 17:17 Nato warships and, potentially, drones are to help the EU control migrant flows across the Mediterranean in what critics have called the \"militarisation of a humanitarian crisis\". Nato head Jens Stoltenberg unveiled the new project, to be called operation Sea Guardian, on the last day of a summit in Warsaw on Saturday (9 July).

Watch our founder Lisbeth Kirk explain the reasons in this 30 seconds video. Migrant flows shifted back toward Libya and Italy after the EU shut the Greek-Balkan corridor (Photo: euoparl.europa.eu) \"We have decided to transform operation Active Endeavour into a broader security mission called Sea Guardian\", he said. \"We intend to work closely with the European Union's operation Sophia in the central Mediterranean, building on our swift and effective cooperation with the EU to cut lines of international human trafficking in the Aegean\", he said. Speaking more broadly about the terrorist threat to Europe and the migration crisis, he added: \"The scale of the task requires that we undertake joint efforts\". Active Endeavour is an old Nato mission that was launched after 9/11 to protect shipping in the Straits of Gibraltar from terrorist attacks. Sophia is an EU naval mission, launched last year, to stem the flow of migrants from Libya to Italy. Stoltenberg's mention of the Aegean refers to Nato's decision, in February, to send seven warships to help stop migrant boats going from Turkey to Greece. Sea Guardian Nato officials said it was too early to publish details on when Sea Guardian would start work, what assets it would have, and what it would do. But according to Nato literature, Active Endeavour was composed of Greek, Italian, Spanish and Turkish warships as well as Danish, German and Norwegian patrol boats. A Nato source told EUobserver that Nato's new drones would \"very likely\" play a role in Sea Guardian. The Western alliance, outside the summit venue in Warsaw, put on display one of the five Global Hawk machines that it recently bought from US firm Northrop Grumman and that are designed to start operations at the Sigonella air base in Italy in 2017. They fly at high altitudes for up to 30 hours, covering areas larger than 100,000 square km, and transmitting almost real-time images. The Warsaw summit declaration said Nato was ready to help Sophia on \"intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance\" as well as \"capacity building of the Libyan coastguard and navy\". With the Islamic State jihadist group active in Libya, a separate Nato press statement said that Sea Guardian would \"have a broad scope, including providing situational awareness, countering trafficking and terrorism, upholding freedom of navigation and contributing to regional capacity building\". Stoltenberg and Nato leaders, such as British PM David Cameron, said the joint EU-Nato operations in the Aegean had helped to reduce the number of people crossing from Turkey from 2,000 a day to fewer than 70 per day. The steep drop is mainly based on an EU-Turkey deal under which Turkey stops migrants from embarking and takes them back from Greece. Militarisation of misery Leading NGOs have voiced strident criticism of Europe's handling of the migration crisis, with some, such as Doctors Without Borders, boycotting EU funds in protest. The New York-based Human Rights Watch on Saturday attacked the new Nato operation. \"Nato's involvement in migration control signals a dangerous shift toward militarisation of a humanitarian crisis\", the organisation's Judith Sunderland said. She urged the EU to \"expand safe and legal routes to Europe\", adding: \"Nato help for EU operations should avoid trapping people in lawless and violent Libya, either through forced returns or asking Libyan forces to send people back\". US leader Barack Obama, speaking on Saturday, said that migrants are good for Europe's economy and that German chancellor Angela Merkel \"deserves enormous credit\" for taking in hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees. \"It's economics 101 - if you've got a younger population, your growth rate is going to be higher, and immigrants are strivers and they work hard\", he said. He added that the \"huge influxes of the sort that we've seen in Europe - that's always going to be a shock to the system\". \"It's a strain on the budget. It's a strain on politics. It's a strain on culture. It's legitimate for them [EU leaders] to say: 'Look, we've got to slow this thing down. We've got to manage it properly',\" he said.

When we started implementing our Global Strategy for foreign and security policy, our first step was to create the first ever command centre for our military training and advisory Missions, and to set up a permanent link between this new military structure and the central command of their civilian colleagues. Our 16 Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) Missions and Operations on the ground have become an essential feature of our foreign policy. Our women and men some 2,000 civilians and 3,300 military staff are deployed in Europe, in the Middle East, and in Africa: they may serve far from home, but they contribute directly to our own security inside the European Union. It is also thanks to our Missions, that our partners around the world increasingly look at the European Union as a global security provider: they know we are a reliable power, and an indispensable partner for global peace and security. This second Annual Report provides an overview of the achievements and activities of our ten civilian Missions (in Kosovo, Ukraine, Georgia, Niger, Mali, the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Iraq, Libya, and Somalia) and six military Missions and Operations (in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Central Mediterranean, Somalia [on land and off the coast], Mali, and the Central African Republic). The Report also covers a new hybrid civilian and military Regional Coordination Cell with staff in each country in the G5 Sahel (Chad, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali). Security threats have changed, and this makes our civilian and military engagement mix even more important than before. Some observers predicted some kind of fatigue for our military and civilian engagement abroad. Yet, we just set up a new civilian Mission to support the stabilisation of Iraq 5 CSDP Annual Report I 05 in this crucial moment of its history, after the country was liberated from Da esh. This Mission includes, for the first time ever, an expert on the protection of cultural heritage something I am very proud of. As threats evolve, we are continually seeking new ways of working for peace, security and sustainable development. The European approach to security and defence lies precisely in this careful mix between targeted civilian and military actions: this is what makes the European Union such a unique security player in the world. This is the European way to peace and security. When others have questioned the United Nations and multilateralism, we have invested even more strongly in the global governance system, not just at the strategic level but on the ground. Many of our Missions and Operations work directly with the United Nations and with the African Union; in Ukraine and Georgia we cooperate closely with the OSCE; in Niger we work with the International Organisation on Migration. Our work on security and defence this year has not just focused on our Missions and Operations. We brought our cooperation with NATO to an unprecedented level: last year we announced 42 joint actions with NATO, and in December 2017 we added 34 more actions to the list. We established a Coordinated Annual Review of national defence budgets, and with the European Commission we set up a European Defence Fund: for the first time ever, we are committing common resources to invest in defence to help Member States spend better by spending together. With 25 Member States we launched a Permanent Structured Cooperation on defence: a historic move to facilitate cooperation between our armed forces, fill some crucial gaps in our capabilities, and make our defence spending much more efficient. All this progress comes with a sense of pride and accomplishment. At the same time, this is not a conclusion to our work on security and defence, rather a new beginning. The world we live in is not just unpredictable or unstable, but confused. Our citizens and our partners need a strong point of reference a credible, cooperative and reliable power. We now have all the tools to be the global power our citizens and the world need, including in the field of security and defence. Europe is what we make of it, and we are already at work to shape our next steps towards a European Union of security and defence. Federica Mogherini High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy / Vice-President of the Commission 6 CSDP Annual Report I 06 Esa Pulkkinen Director General, EU Military Staff Kenneth Deane Civilian Operations Commander/ Director CPCC Overview by Civilian Operations Commander and Director, Military Planning and Conduct Capability What did we do in 2017? From the civilian perspective, to strengthen the resilience and stabilisation of partner countries recovering from or affected by conflict and instability, we conducted around 530 training events for over 11,000 people (of whom at least 1,720 were women) on topics such as combatting weapons- and people-trafficking, forensic techniques, crime scene management, human resources management, recruitment, legislative drafting, public order policing, community policing, combatting corruption, identifying document fraud, the application of local laws on irregular migration, civil registration, integrated border management, maritime security, and human rights and gender. We mentored 2,490 middle and senior leadership level staff from police services, judicial bodies, and senior officials of Ministries of Interior and Justice, including Ministers, Chiefs of Police and Heads of Judicial Councils themselves. We prosecuted or adjudicated 39 criminal trials, and monitored 290 criminal cases, all to do with either war crimes or serious and organised crime. We influenced the drafting of almost 200 laws and national or regional institutional or governmental policies and strategies by advising and providing language on subjects such as civilian security sector reform, criminal procedure codes, seizure of criminal assets, money laundering, and court jurisdiction. We supplied 8.4m worth of equipment to local partners and local NGOs, ranging from, inter alia, vehicles to reflective vests, mobile garages to evidence kits, cameras to solar energy capacity, and mooring ropes to case-management software.7 CSDP Annual Report I 07 We handled 1,400 calls on our Hotline to reduce tensions and conducted 100 interviews consulting local actors on the future shape of CSDP work in the Sahel. From the military perspective, we established, for the first time, an operational Headquarters the Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC) - for military Missions and Operations. We also established, together with civilian colleagues in the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC), a Joint Support Coordination Cell in order to exploit as much as possible civilian-military synergies, especially on matters of Mission support. In theatre, our work included counter terrorism, and combatting irregular migration. To support capacity building, we conducted both executive and non-executive Missions and Operations holding multiple short- and long-term training events for around 4,400 people on topics such as mortar firing, infantry skills, force organisation, sniper skills, engineering, logistics, tactical air control, and intelligence gathering. The human rights dimension is systematically embedded in our training. We delivered mine awareness training to 17,786 citizens, and ensured that 313,000 metric tonnes of World Food Programme aid safely reached Somalia by sea. We mentored multiple senior military officials on Security Sector Reform (SSR), and supported them not only on SSR, but on Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration. We continued to operate our two naval Operations, in the Mediterranean Sea and in the Western Indian Ocean which intervened to counter piracy and disrupt human trafficking and smuggling, saving some 10,759 lives in so doing. What did we achieve in 2017? In Kosovo we implemented EU-facilitated Dialogue Agreements on justice integration, border management integration, and on civil registration, thus promoting normalisation and stabilisation between Kosovo and Serbia. Furthermore, we continued to support the Specialist Chambers, a court established in The Hague, to hear allegations of grave violations of humanitarian law during the conflict in Kosovo. In Ukraine we saw the Minister of Internal Affairs adopt a Development Strategy , based on Mission advice. This will strengthen the policy-making role of the Ministry within the civilian SSR landscape and set clear reform priorities for the Ministry and its five subordinated agencies. In Georgia we reduced tension and facilitated agreements between the conflict parties through our Hotline and improved our capacity to monitor and report through the use of new technology.8 CSDP Annual Report I 08 In Palestine we supported further capacity of the key institution on border management, through the development of operational manuals, and saw the Palestinian Civil Police endorse a policy on community policing for the first time. In Libya, we increased our capacity to operate more frequently on the ground in Tripoli. This enabled us to closely support an important Concept Paper on the reform of the integrated border management system, as well as the re-activation of the Justice Improvement Working Group. In Iraq, establishing the Mission in just 4 months, in response to an Iraqi request for EU assistance, was in itself an achievement. In Niger, we saw Presidential approval of the National Strategy for Internal Security, the culmination of several years work, and we inaugurated our Field Office in Agadez. We also saw previously trained-by-the-mission Nigerien trainers begin to deliver training themselves to their colleagues. In Mali we strengthened the capacity of the Brigade d Investigation Specialisee (BIS) through the provision of specialised training and equipment, as well as advice on improving investigation practices, and supported Malian efforts to redeploy internal security forces in central Mali. Also in Mali we supported the development of the Malian Armed Forces organisational structures. Elsewhere in the Sahel, we established a civilian-military Regional Coordination Cell, signalling the EU s commitment to support the G5 (Niger, Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania) countries security sector reform efforts, and advised on the establishment of the G5 Force Conjointe. In Somalia we progressed the definition of the Somali Maritime Security Architecture through our formal leadership role in the internationally agreed Comprehensive Approach to Security, thus enabling better, more coordinated strategic decisionmaking for Somali partners to deliver their maritime objectives as the Federal Coast Guard and Regional Maritime Police Units are established. Also in Somalia we supported the drafting of the Somali National Defence Strategy, and we also transitioned from providing training to individuals, to collective unit training of the military. In the Mediterranean Sea, we saved 10,759 lives, handed over 30 smugglers to the Italian authorities, and decommissioned 155 smuggler vessels. In the Indian Ocean, we made a significant contribution to the reduction in piracy, with 12 attempted pirate attacks in 2017 thwarted, and the detention and transfer of 6 suspected pirates to the Seychelles authorities.9 CSDP Annual Report I 09 In the Central African Republic, we supported the validation and signature of the National Defence Plan and the founding documents of the Armed Forces Staff Organisational structures. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we supported the first-ever joint large-scale exercise of the Bosnian police, army and EUFOR, which demonstrated the markedly increased tactical capability of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Moldova, we helped to develop a National Strategy for countering illegal tobacco and led joint operations that resulted in the seizure of 1,706 firearms, over 179,000 rounds of ammunition and more than 950 grenades. Finally, at our civilian headquarters in Brussels (the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability, CPCC) we standardised our approaches to a number of core functions in order to increase efficiency and effectiveness of mandate delivery by drafting operational guidelines on gender mainstreaming, police-prosecutor co-operation and anti-corruption practices. We also established a new Security and Duty of Care section, employing a medical expert for the first time. Headquarters staff gave presentations at over 130 crisis management workshops, conferences and training sessions in Brussels and throughout the EU addressing a cumulative audience of some 800, drawn mainly from the EU, but also from other countries like China, and the United States, and organisations like NATO, the OSCE and the UN. We continued to advocate for Member States to nominate a gender-balance in the candidates they propose to the Missions. In 2017, 30% of our civilian Heads of Mission were women. We want to get back to 50% again in the future! Who did we work with? Partnership is a key principle in our work on security and defence. In 2017, as well as with the EU Delegations in theatre, we worked with over 150 national counterparts (local Ministries of Interior, of Security, of Justice, of Foreign Affairs, and law enforcement associations such as Judicial Councils and Policing Boards), and almost 180 international partners. These include, for example, EU agencies such as FRONTEX and EUROPOL, the United Nations, OSCE, INTERPOL, the African Union; Non-Government Organisations, like the International Organisation for Migration, and other country development agencies both EU & non-eu, like Japan, the US, and Canada. 10 CSDP Annual Report I 10 Our local partners are of paramount importance to us, so it is gratifying to learn that they value our work, as this quote, from Lieutenant Ousmane of the National Guard in Niger, shows: EUCAP Sahel Niger is the lung of the National Guard! Finally, as the EEAS Secretary General, Helga Schmid has noted Promoting international peace and security is part of the EU s DNA: it is beneficial for the EU itself and its citizens as well as for our partners. Conflict parties and the international community are increasingly turning towards the EU to support peace efforts, be it in Africa, broader Middle East or our immediate neighbourhood. The CSDP Missions and Operations are a significant and concrete example of our engagement and form part of a broad toolbox of instruments at our disposal to deal with the crises in an integrated manner. We hope you enjoy and are informed by this, our 2 nd Annual Report, and we commend it to you! Kenneth Deane Civilian Operations Commander/ Director CPCC Esa Pulkkinen Director General, EU Military Staff 11 12 CSDP Annual Report I 12 EU Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) KOSOVO Worked with 800 staff on developing rule of law capacity on the fight against organised crime and corruption through mentoring and advising, as well as using executive powers to investigate, prosecute and adjudicate on criminal and civil matters. Integration of 40 Kosovo Serb judges, 14 prosecutors as well as support staff in the Kosovo judicial system, through EULEX implementation of EU-facilitated Dialogue Agreements was an important development for rule of law in Kosovo. These Kosovo Serb judges are now able to work as judges and prosecutors at all levels within the Kosovo judiciary system. Implementation of the EU-facilitated Dialogue Agreement on the Integrated Border Management Technical Protocol by negotiating the start of construction works at the Common Crossing Points. Establishment of the Systematic Electronic Exchange of Data (SEED) Technical Group (a EULEX initiative), was another significant development in the normalisation of the relations between Pristina and Belgrade, as it established the first direct communication in this field between representatives of the two parties. Mission presence had been requested by several local judges and prosecutors during several sensitive cases handled by Kosovo judges to guarantee a fair process and prompt adjudication. Organised 11 training events for 173 participants (57 ) on corrections, investigation of serious crime offences against sexual integrity, prosecuting corruption cases, law enforcement in the field of inter-ethnic incidents, border management, civil registry and INTERPOL cooperation principles. INFLUENCING LAWS AND POLICIES Advised on 25 laws, including amendments to the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code and 31 bye-laws, including on financing political parties, asylum, foreigners, criminal justice and bye-laws in regards to correctional services, prosecution, internal police inspectorate, identity cards and license plates, resulted in changes to these laws. Supported the opening of the Civil Registration Offices for issuance of documents and vehicle registration in the four northern municipalities through the drafting of Administrative Instructions, and the provision of equipment and training. The offices became fully functional in early Prosecuted 39 criminal trials on serious and organised crime at all levels (Basic Court, Appeals Court, Supreme Court). Advised and mentored local counterparts on 9 policies and strategies including migration management, border security, customs, civil registry, execution of penal sanctions, forensics and domestic violence. PRACTICAL SUPPORT 2,762,500 worth of equipment no longer in use by the Mission (vehicles, ambulances, computers, handheld radios) was donated to the Kosovo Ministries and the Civil Registry Agency. Mentored and advised 300 people on civil registry, migration and citizenship, internal police inspection, public order policing, integrated border management, and correctional services. Monitored over 290 criminal cases which had been transferred to local authorities by the Mission. OUR PARTNERS SAY This training will immensely help our investigators that work in the field of economic crimes. Besnik Sallahu, Deputy Head of International Legal Cooperation Unit, Kosovo Police 13 CSDP Annual Report I 13 EU Advisory Mission (EUAM) UKRAINE Worked with 235 staff on civilian security sector reform assisting the Ukrainian authorities with strategic advice and hands-on advice, and support at operational level. Provision of methodological guidance, and drafting advice, as well as Strategic Communications advisory support during the public consultation stage resulted in the adoption of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Development Strategy Ensured local buy-in and ownership of the National Police leadership in the operational implementation of the police reform concepts proposed by the Mission. Concepts dealt with senior leadership training, community policing, intelligence-led policing and dialogue policing, quick-response teams, crowd management. Unprecedented access to decision-making within the NPU was achieved through mentorship. Prosecutor General approval of the EUAM-drafted Roadmap of Prosecutorial Reform, which envisages actionable measures in the areas of prosecutorial independence, responsibility, qualification and effectiveness. Greater openness of Ministry of Internal Affairs towards the media, with an increase in the number of interviews and a more positive attitude towards the media. Mentored 15 people at strategic level and 21 people at district level. Senior Leadership training and participation at the NPU Senior Management meetings (retreats of EUAM Management Board with all NPU regional commanders). on Amendments to the Law on Pre-trial Detention, on the Security Service of Ukraine, and on Amendments to the Code on Administrative Offences. The policing aspects of the Human Rights Action Plan was developed with the support of the Mission. PRACTICAL SUPPORT 1,223,459 of equipment donated in the form of vehicles, a mobile police station, computers, printers, megaphones, reflective vests and forensic kits. OUR PARTNERS SAY Together with the EU Advisory Mission Ukraine, we have defined our future goals. The 2020 Strategy is a logical continuation of the changes which have already begun. The future directions which have been defined will increase the role of law enforcement agencies in society, strengthen contact with the populations, implement new approaches to and opinions of our work with service functions as a priority. Arsen Avakov, Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine This important experiment will assist us to effectively reform the police and not just reform for the sake of reform. The merger of these two functions [ operatives and investigators ] to create a position of detective will allow citizens to work together with police officers, who will be on top of the all information concerning their investigations to a maximum. Serhiy Knyazyev, Chief of the National Police of Ukraine Organised 206 trainings delivered to 4215 people (1123 ). INFLUENCING LAWS AND POLICIES Contributed to 22 legislative initiatives and 16 national or regional policies. For example the Mission s advice was incorporated into the Draft Laws on The National Security of Ukraine, on Amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code, There are 100 articles of the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine which should be corrected according to the opinion of the working group [consisting of EUAM experts and Ukrainian officials]. Yuriy Lutsenko, Prosecutor General of Ukraine 14 CSDP Annual Report I 14 EU Monitoring Mission (EUMM) GEORGIA Worked with 319 staff on the implementation of the Six-Point Ceasefire Agreement between Georgia and Russia to stabilise and normalise the situation on the ground, reduce tension and build confidence, and to inform EU policy. EUMM is the only international presence permanently on the ground. Defused tension and prevented escalation through the Mission s trusted conflict prevention Hotline, which had over 1400 activations. In addition, a Mission proposal within the framework of the Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism for South Ossetia to increase the scope of activities in the security sphere that would be pre-announced via the Hotline was tacitly agreed by the participants. Improved quality of monitoring and reporting through the implementation of new technological means. These included, for example, using vehicles with masts that increase the range of observation in certain areas along the Administrative Boundary Line and further integration of the EU Satellite Centre GeoMap system into patrol planning and information analysis. Facilitated positive developments in Freedom of Movement enabling people to access religious sites and agricultural land, despite the negative environment. Enhanced Mission ability to quickly redeploy staff across all locations to be better able to quickly react to incidents in the Area of Responsibility and increase its presence in certain areas when needed in order to promote stability. Conducted our 60, 000 th patrol since the Mission began work on 1 October In 2017, conducted 4,827 patrols, and enabled and responded to 1400 activations of the Hotline. PRACTICAL SUPPORT Supported 10 projects under the Confidence Building Facility to the value of 150,000, contributing to civil society dialogue and exchange across the Administrative Boundary Lines. Among the projects launched were an internet radio station in the Abkhaz language for unbiased fact-based news, a training series for internally displaced women in civil engagement with a view to enhancing their participation in peace building processes, and a workshop for young leaders from Abkhazia and Tbilisi-administrated Territory on how to overcome environmental challenges through cooperation across the Administrative Boundary Line. OUR PARTNERS SAY Information Sharing Meetings organised by the EUMM are the most important meetings of the month. It is very important for us to have a network and place to change ideas and give updates. Representative of a Georgian NGO I appreciate very much that you are following and interested in what is happening in our villages and to our people. It means a lot to us to see the EUMM presence in the village. Local Government Representative from Pakhulani village EUMM is very important for the stability. I know that you can t go to Abkhazia, but without you we don t know what would happen. Internally displaced person from Gali, currently living in Ganmukhuri village Launched a gender integrated tasking initiative in an effort to enable Mission Monitors to integrate a gender perspective into their patrolling activities and reports. Progress was monitored at the field office level through monthly reporting by Gender Focal Points to Mission headquarters. I am grateful to EUMM for its important role played in the area. The locals are happy to see Mission members around. Elderly Georgian man talking to a patrol 15 CSDP Annual Report I 15 E U A M I R A Q EU Advisory Mission (EUAM) IRAQ The newest Mission, it has 51 staff, and was established on 16 October 2017 by the Council of the European Union in response to a request from the Iraqi Government for advice and assistance on the implementation of civilian aspects of the National Security Strategy. Planned and established in a record time (4 months) followed by swift deployment. The Head of Mission and his core staff arrived to Baghdad in November and the Mission was officially inaugurated by the Civilian Operations Commander later that month in the presence of Iraqi counterparts from the Minister of Interior, National Security Adviser s office, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, the Prime Minister, law enforcement and intelligence agencies, as well as international counterparts (UN agencies, NATO, Global Coalition, US, Canada, Australia, Japan), and Member State representatives. Started work on its core mandate to support the implementation of the civilian aspects of the Iraqi National Security Strategy and the civilian aspects of the Security Sector Reform Programme led by the Office of the National Security Adviser. This has included institutional development of the Iraqi National Security Architecture focusing on support to the Office of the National Security Advisor and the Ministry of Interior. Since its inauguration the Mission has established close contacts and coordination channels with key international partners including the United Nations, NATO, the United States and permanent representatives of the EU Members States present in Iraq. It has established regular coordination meetings with the EU Delegation and participated in a workshop with EU Development Aid on humanitarian development. INFLUENCING LAWS AND POLICIES The Mission supported the Office of the National Security Adviser and the Ministry of Interior through embedded advisers, providing expertise on counter-terrorism and violent extremism, organised crime (trafficking in human beings, weapons, drugs, cybercrime, illicit trafficking and/ or destruction of cultural goods), the development of the national security architecture within the context of the national security strategy and institutional reform. OUR PARTNERS SAY The deployment of EUAM is an essential EU assistance to support Iraq in its security sector reforms, building on Iraq s efforts in defeating Da esh. EUAM would provide valuable assistance to Iraq in developing its own solutions concerning implementation of overall security strategy, reforms of management, counter-terrorism and organised crime. Prime Minister Al-Abadi I welcome the EU s swift support to assist Iraq and its Government in re-developing civilian policing following the defeat of Da esh. Senior Deputy Minister of Interior Dr. Aqeel al-khazali The Mission s Senior Strategic Advisers have identified key interlocutors in the Ministry of Interior and Office of National Security Adviser, and established working relations. The modalities of Mission advisers embedment in these institutions have been arranged so as to ensure daily interaction and continuous assistance. eeas.europa.eu/csdp-missions-operations/euam-iraq_en 16 CSDP Annual Report I 16 EU Co-ordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES Worked with 114 staff on reform and development of the Ministry of Interior, the Palestinian Civil Police and the Criminal Justice Institutions, with a focus on police-prosecution cooperation through training, mentoring and strategic level advice.

Presidential approval of the Nigerien National Strategy for Internal Security in September. The Mission was the only international actor to actively participate in the Committee in charge of the drafting of the strategy, which aims, among other things, to develop the efficiency of the regional operational command centres to improve the response to crises and the interoperability of security forces. Inaugurated the compound of EUCAP Sahel Niger s permanent field office in Agadez in April. The Mission is currently the only international actor permanently present in Agadez in the field of security. The Agadez region is facing the highest number of security threats, and the Mission s support has been highly welcomed by the local authorities and security forces - notably in the fields of the fight against arms and drugs trafficking, and irregular migration and related crimes, such as human smuggling and document fraud. The Train-the-Trainers approach is bearing fruit. In 2017, the Mission trained 158 trainers. In order to ensure sustainability and durability, the instructors trained by the Mission are now leading trainings on their own, accompanied by EUCAP Sahel Niger. In 2017, 58 trainers were mentored by the Mission s experts. As an example, in the fields of forensics, intelligence and professional intervention, the Mission accompanied 36 Nigerien trainers during their work. Consequently, more than 270 persons were instructed by the EUCAP-mentored Nigerien trainers in these areas in Convened the EUCAP Sahel Niger Steering Committee twice, a top-level coordination body including 6 government Ministers that draws together all the principal political actors involved in the Mission s mandate and helps ensure national ownership of Mission activities. Organised 198 training events for 3419 people (162 ) on issues such as forensics, document fraud, criminal investigation techniques, public order, crisis management and drug and weapons trafficking awareness.

It was an immense opportunity to take part in this training. I hope my female colleagues will join this effort to reach gender equality. Marshal Awa Kante, Gendarmerie Intervention Trainer, 21 EUROPEAN UNION CSDP Annual Report I 21 TRAINING MISSION MALI EU Training Mission (EUTM) MALI Worked with 581 staff on the training and advice of the Malian Armed Forces on improving its military capacity in order to provide for the restoration of full territorial integrity under civilian authority. OBJECTIVES EUTM Mali provides training, advice and education to the Malian Armed Forces in order to enhance its military capacity to provide security and enable the restoration of full Malian territorial integrity under civilian authority. Continued to develop the Malian Armed Forces organisational structures, including supporting important projects for the functioning and Command and Control (C2) of the MaAF like the Logistic Information System (LOGIS), the Human Resources Information and Management System (HRMIS) and the Programme d Appui au renforcement de la securite et de la Protection Civile (PARSEC). Conducted Mobile Advisory and Training Teams (MATT) in the 5 southern Military Regions (MR) and in Gao and Timbuktu regions contributing to the ability to decentralise advising and training activities. Contributed to the establishment of the G5 Sahel Force Conjointe (FC) as a new and important security actor in the region through the provision of advice and guidance in the start-up phase. Organised training for the Sous-Groupements Tactiques InterArmes, as well as Train-the-Trainer (TTT) courses for MaAF Officers and NCOs and military academy instructors for a total of 2295 MaAF personnel. Subjects were on leadership, medical training, small and support arms courses, operational courses, engineering and logistics. A part of this work was dedicated to specialised training most notably the Guideur Aerien Tactique Avance (GATA), sniper, and Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), artillery and mortar course which concluded with a Live Firing Exercise, something that the MaAF had not achieved for several years. In combining TTT courses and specialist training at KTC, EUTM continues to encourage the MaAF to assume responsibility and ownership themselves. In addition, every time EUTM Mali gives courses, International Humanitarian Law and Gender lessons are included, as well as medical lessons. Worked on, at General Staff level, the Loi de Programmation Militaire (LOPM), that currently governs military expenditure, and on the preparation of the next LOPM, due to come into force in COMMITMENT With 581 staff deployed, EUTM Mali provides training, advice and education to the MaAF. Most training is focused at the operational level through courses such as sniper courses, indirect fire (Mortar, Artillery, Tactical Air Control Party), logistic courses, engineering courses, counter-ied, Human Rights and International Humanitarian courses. At a strategic level, EUTM Mali works side by side with EMGA (Etat Major Generale des Armees) by giving advice on a dayto-day basis to the decision-makers within the MaAF. It is our strong belief that by enhancing the leadership skills of young Malian officers and NCOs, both in the military academies and during training, and emphasising their sense of responsibility and accountability, a long lasting, positive effect on MaAF performance will be achieved. These are core elements of all training and instruction. Only by respecting these fundamentals will the MaAF be accepted by the population and recognised for what they do. 22 CSDP Annual Report I 22 Regional Coordination Cell Sahel MALI - NIGER- CHAD - BURKINA FASO - MAURITANIA Established in July, the Regional Coordination Cell has 15 staff and represents a new and innovative initiative to complement and make CSDP action in the Sahel more efficient. It is designed to reinforce the EU support for the security and defence structures of Sahel countries, focussing in particular on the G5 Sahel. OBJECTIVES Uniquely, it is one action comprised of both civilian and military personnel, with the strategic objectives of (1) supporting cross-border cooperation, (2) supporting regional cooperation structures, in particular those of G5 Sahel and (3) in this context, to enhance the national capacities of G5 Sahel countries. Developed a methodology for, and began work on, a mapping of the state of play of the defence forces, internal security forces and institutions dealing with cross-border cooperation with a view to identify the main gaps and needs along with related recommendations, constituting the basis for drafting a CSDP Regional Implementation Plan. The idea is that while building on the existing CSDP Missions in the Sahel (EUCAP Mali, EUTM Mali and EUCAP Niger), the RCC will explore the possibility to enlarge the CSDP presence in the region, with concrete proposals for actions, both at regional and national level. This, of course, requires a realistic and technical overview and assessment of the current state of play in the G5 Countries. LOCATION The RCC has its headquarters in Bamako co-located with EUCAP Sahel Mali where 7 of its staff are based. Another 7 staff, Internal Security and Defence Experts, are embedded in the EU Delegations in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mauritania and Niger. This network is complemented by the three CSDP Sahel Missions (EUCAP Sahel Mali, EUTM Mali and EUCAP Sahel Niger) who have appointed focal points for regionalisation. A Brussels Support Element (BSE) at the operational headquarters in Brussels complements this lay-down. Organised a seminar with the participation of Mission and Delegations representatives, to fine tune the regional approach and to discuss about the future developments in the region. Conducted more than one hundred meetings and interviews by the Internal Security and Defence Experts, the focal points and the RCC HQ staff. In addition, the Internal Security and Defence Experts are supporting the Delegations where they are located in the sector of their expertise. Planned the facilitation of, for the G5 Sahel countries security and defence trainees, the organisation of training courses delivered by the existing CSDP Missions in the Sahel.

EUNAVFOR continued its core work of deterring, preventing and repressing acts of piracy in the Gulf of Aden and the Western Indian Ocean. OBJECTIVES Pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1816, Operation ATALANTA works to protect vulnerable shipping, including World Food Programme (WFP) vessels delivering food aid to Somalia; to deter, prevent and repress acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea; and to monitor fishing activity off the coast of Somalia. In addition, EU NAVFOR supports within means and capabilities other EU Missions, institutions and instruments working within Somalia and EU regional programmes addressing maritime security issues, for example Critical Maritime Routes Indian Ocean (CRIMARIO), Maritime Security (MASE), and monitoring fishing activity off the coast of Somalia. Significantly contributed, together with its international partners, to the reduction in piracy. At the height of Somalibased piracy in January 2011, 736 hostages and 32 vessels were held captive. As of November 2017, no vessels or crew of International Maritime Organisation-registered vessel were being held hostage by pirates. Despite a spike in piracy activities during 2017, all 12 attempted pirate attacks failed. In November 2017, 6 suspected pirates were successfully detained and transferred to the Seychellois authorities for further judicial processing. Maintained a 100% success rate in protecting WFP vessels delivering aid to Somalia, with just over 313,000 metric tonnes of food aid delivered in The prosecution of pirates apprehended by EU NAVFOR and transferred to regional states for trial (known as the legal finish ) remains essential to the campaign of credible deterrence. In total, 166 suspected pirates have been transferred by EU NAVFOR since 2009, with 145 convictions, 15 acquittals, and 6 cases pending. The Maritime Security Centre Horn of Africa (MSCHOA), a EU NAVFOR initiative, assesses vessel vulnerability based on voluntary reporting, provides 24/7 support to ships masters transiting the area of operations. MSCHOA has been the lynchpin of EU NAVFOR s relationship with the commercial shipping industry since the launch of the operation. Worked together with other international and multinational counter-piracy operations, and the maritime industry, to apply Best Management Practices (BMP) and use of Private Armed Security Teams (PAST), in the suppression of pirate activity. However, the attack on the Fuel Tanker MV Aris 13 in March 2017 was the first of twelve pirate attacks verified over the year, and clearly shows that the intent and capability, as well as opportunities to commit piracy remains in place. Continued to protect WFP ships delivering food aid to the people of Somalia through escorts, monitoring, and the use of Autonomous Vessel Protection Detachments (AVPDs) on board WFP-charted vessels. Simultaneously, Operation ATALANTA continued to support EUCAP Somalia and EUTM Somalia (its sister Missions as part of the EU Comprehensive Approach to Somalia) including through the provision of training for Somali maritime units in Mogadishu, Puntland and Galmudug. COMMITMENT Averaging 700 staff members, from 19 EU Member states, two EU Candidate Countries and one Third State contributor, EU NAVFOR typically consists of between 1 to 3 surface combat vessels and up to 2 Maritime Patrol Aircraft. The common costs for the Operation in 2017 were 5.3m and it was composed of warships from Spain, Italy, France, the Netherlands and the Republic of Korea; Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPAs) from Spain and Germany; and on-board AVPDs from Montenegro, Serbia and Lithuania. 26 CSDP Annual Report I 26 EU Training Mission (EUTM) CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC Based in Bangui, the EU Military Training Mission in the Central African Republic (EUTM RCA) contributed to the EU s comprehensive approach and security sector reform in the country.

EUFOR remains a vital enabling actor in the development and maintenance of a Safe and Secure Environment (SASE). OBJECTIVES EUFOR is the main military actor in the peace stabilisation role under the General Framework Agreement for Peace, while cooperating closely with NATO under the Berlin Plus Agreement (which enables EUFOR to draw on mobile and versatile reserve forces held in readiness by NATO to augment in-theatre forces and deal with any military contingency that arises, including giving support to the BiH Ministry of Security and the Ministry of Defence upon request). In accordance with its executive mandate under Chapter VII of the UN Charter (UNSC 2384/2017), EUFOR contributes to the maintenance of a SASE in BiH, promoting a climate of peace and stability. Co-organised Exercise Quick Response 17, the first time that BiH law enforcement agencies, armed forces and EUFOR all exercised together in realistic scenarios, in order to test their respective contingency plans. EUFOR called on its Over the Horizon Reserve Force, and its troops included the Multinational Battalion, the KFOR Tactical Reserve and the Intermediate Reserve Force from the UK. Live exercise areas included Sarajevo International Airport, where EUFOR supported the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) and the Border Police as well as the airport authorities. This large-scale exercise demonstrated the remarkable level of tactical capability developed within the AFBiH and underlined the ability of committed reserve forces to deploy into BiH, if required. Continued to support the AFBiH with the safe storage and disposal of all surplus weapons and ammunition. This enhanced safety and will release many AFBiH soldiers tasked with guarding and maintaining the 30 weapon storage sites for training and operational duties. As part of this process, EUFOR is involved in the European Union Assistance to Stockpile Management, Technical Support, and Ammunition Surplus Reduction (EUSTAR) Project. This was launched in July 2017 to ensure close cooperation between local authorities (MoD and Armed Forces of BiH) and international actors (EU, EUFOR and UNDP) designed to contribute to the disposal of approximately 3,000 tons of unsafe and unstable ammunition and complex weapon systems. Conducted 45 training courses for the AFBiH on subjects such as disaster relief, ammunition and weapons storage management and mine risk education. EUFOR continues to provide mine risk education for vulnerable and at risk groups such as farmers, forestry companies, hunting clubs and in particular children of all ages in order to raise awareness and promote safe behaviour. Delivered mine risk education to 17,786 people (1 Jan - 30 Dec 2017). COMMITMENT EUFOR ALTHEA (based mainly in Sarajevo), comprises 600 soldiers from 19 nations including 14 EU member states and 5 partner nations. EUFOR is also able to draw on mobile and versatile Over the Horizon Reserve forces if required. OUR PARTNERS SAY Cooperation with international forces is important, in this case EUFOR, on whose support and assistance we rely in many realistic situations. BiH Minister of Security Dragan Mektic EUFOR provides considerable assistance in checking and raising the level of interoperability of our units for joint activities with the armed forces of the countries of both the European Union and NATO.

OBJECTIVES Operation Sophia is a military crisis management operation that contributes to improving maritime security in the Mediterranean and supports the return of stability and security in Libya. Its primary goal is to contribute to disrupting the business model of the migrant smuggling and human trafficking networks in the Central Mediterranean. Rescued 10, 759 persons at sea, handed over 30 suspected smugglers to the Italian authorities, and decommissioned 155 smuggler vessels. As recognised by the international community, Operation Sophia has achieved a significant deterrent effect against arms smugglers in international waters, with over 1000 merchant vessels hailed, 74 friendly approaches, 7 flag enquiries and 3 boardings conducted. EUNAVFOR MED has trained 201 Library Coast Guard & Navy (LCG&N) personnel in the disruption of all forms of illicit traffic and to carry out search and rescue activities. PARTNERS Thus far, partnership has been the key word: partner countries, partner organisations, NGOs, international agencies who work together and share their experiences on how to manage - from a humanitarian point of view - something that is difficult to manage, especially people that have gone through a very difficult journey. COMMITMENT In 2017, 27 Member States contributed to the operation providing assets, resources, logistic support and personnel, with Italy providing the Operational Headquarters. In 2017, both Italy and Spain provided Flagships. For the training of the LCG&N, many Member States made voluntary financial contributions and provided facilities ashore, with Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK deploying training teams. Additional support is provided by EU, international and NGO organisations including FRONTEX, EASO, UNSMIL, UNHCR, IOM, CISOM and the RAVA IT foundation. Training packages have been delivered on board Dutch and Italian ships and at training facilities ashore in Greece, Italy and Malta. Greece, Italy and Spain will also host further training ashore in Further contribution from Member States and partners are anticipated. The biannual Shared Awareness and De-Confliction in the Mediterranean Forum (SHADE MED) continues to promote coordination and de-confliction between different governmental and non-governmental, military and nonmilitary actors. Over 200 participants including NGOs and shipping organisations attended SHADE MED 5 in November eeas.europa.eu/csdp/missions-and-operations/eunavfor-med/index_en.htm 29 CSDP Annual Report I 29 EUFOR *EU Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) MOLDOVA AND UKRAINE Worked with 167 staff to promote border controls, customs and trade practices that meet EU standards on the Moldova-Ukraine border. It contributes to cross-border co-operation and confidence-building measures for the peaceful settlement of the Transnistria conflict. Approval of a Ukrainian National Strategy for Countering the Illegal Manufacture and Turnover of Tobacco Goods, after a two-year effort in which the Mission supported the Ukrainian authorities in developing the strategy by contributing to the text. Led joint border control operations that targeted the illegal movement of firearms, explosives, chemical, biological, radiological and cigarette smuggling routes in Moldova and Ukraine. The operations led to seizures of 1706 firearms, over 179,000 rounds of ammunition, and more than 950 grenades. Seven cigarette consignments, totalling 120 million pieces, were monitored. Provided input to the new draft agreement on establishing joint control on the Moldova-Ukraine border that was signed between the Heads of the Republic of Moldova s General Border Police Department and Ukraine s State Border Guard Service in October. Mentored around 1800 border and customs officers from Moldova and Ukraine, out of which 90% at the operational level. EUBAM experts are present directly on Moldova- Ukraine border and are working shoulder to shoulder with Moldovan and Ukrainian partners providing on-the-job mentoring every day. The main topics of the mentoring sessions were risk analysis, trade and phytosanitary control standards, container profiling and control, tracking, scanning of containers and interpretation of scanned images and import clearance procedure of international postal deliveries. INFLUENCING LAWS AND POLICIES Reviewed and advised on 17 laws, the most relevant ones being in the field of the Molodovan and Ukrainian Customs Codes, joint control, authorised economic operators, Post-Clearance Audit and intellectual property rights. Reviewed and advised on 12 national policies, the most important ones being developing the Moldovan Risk Management Strategy, Customs Strategy, and Integrated Border Management Strategy; the Ukrainian National Strategy for Countering the Illegal Manufacture and Turnover of Tobacco Goods and Ukraine s accession to the Regional Convention on Pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin. PRACTICAL SUPPORT Fourteen vehicles were handed over to partners as part of the sustainability and handover strategy. OUR PARTNERS SAY Our Border Guards receive very useful on-the-job mentoring from the Mission s experts, such as on conducting risk assessments and analysis. Lieutenant Colonel Sergey Oleynichenko, Assistant to the Chief of the Ukraine Border Guard Detachment Before last year, when we received access to Interpol databases, the Mission helped us to check real-time information on international databases. That had a major effect on our ability to detect cross-border crime. Colonel Andriy Biloborodchenko, Head of the Press Office of Ukraine s State Border Guard Service s Southern Regional Directorate Thanks to the technical and methodological assistance provided by EUBAM, we have succeeded in implementing a number of international best practices that have significantly improved the work of the customs authority. Mr Vitalie Vrabie, Director General of the Moldovan Customs Service *This Mission is not managed within CSDP structures and hence is strictly speaking not a CSDP Mission. However its objectives are very similar to the other CSDP Missions and so we include it here. 30 CSDP Annual Report I 30 Supporting the civilian Missions BRUSSELS Mission support staff are the backbone of our Missions, ensuring the Missions are able to deliver their mandates safe in the knowledge that their computers and other information technology systems, vehicles, recruitment, medical services, logistics chains, buildings, archives, accounts are managed professionally. Establishing and maintaining Missions in foreign territories - this year notably in Baghdad and Tripoli - and managing some 2000 multi-lingual and multi-cultural staff in order for them to deliver on their mandates is an enormous task. That s why Mission Support, both in the Missions and at the Headquarters in Brussels, is a core part of our ability to deliver on our mandates as set by EU Member States. In 2017, we ve seen some major developments on that front. We began contractual negotiations on a common Warehouse for all of our equipment, with view to making it faster and more efficient to deploy. In the same vein, we strengthened and centralised support functions by recruiting more personnel for the Mission Support Platform who filled temporary gaps and boosted capacity across all the civilian Missions. From December 2016-November 2017 we advertised 824 international positions for our Missions, for which we received 5,157 applications in 49 rounds of recruitment, which all had to be processed. Of these applicants, 83% came from men, and 17% came from women. Of the successful candidates, 23% were women and 77% were men. At leadership level, of our ten Heads of Mission, 30% are women and 70 % are men. HORIZONTAL ISSUES: RECRUITMENT, GENDER, SAFETY & SECURITY We overhauled our recruitment procedures, further developing our Human Resources and Force Generation Handbooks to standardise all procedures insofar as possible. We then matched these with the e-recruitment Goalkeeper software, activated from May, which many Member States have already utilised. Next year, we hope to develop our core responsiveness capacity even more, noting that in November the Council agreed to a responsiveness concept that will increase our ability to start up new Missions more quickly and to deliver against the mandate once a political decision has been taken. This consists of a reinforced Mission Support Platform, with the centre of gravity in the existing Missions and as part of an effort to increase the overall staffing rate of Missions. In 2017, we increased our efforts on raising the level of gender and human rights integration across all our Mission activities, from improving gender balance to taking a more gender and HR sensitive approach as essential part of successful mandate implementation. All Missions now have provision for a Gender or Gender and Human Rights Adviser, and six Missions have a fully established and functioning gender focal point system, in part because we engaged experts for Gender and & Human Rights advisory positions in two Missions (Libya and Somalia) where before no dedicated position existed. Some of the positive results from the past year include the adoption of a Gender Strategy by the Palestinian Police: a Draft Decision to establish a Gender Unit within the Director General of the National Police in Mali; a revised working methodology for our patrols in Georgia; new engagement with women s organisations in Somali (facilitating the women s relationship with local authorities including the Attorney General s office): and a focus on police-prosecutor management of domestic violence cases in Kosovo. At headquarters, we began the development of concrete operational guidance for all Mission staff on effective gender mainstreaming. The safety and security of our staff is of paramount importance to us, especially given that we operate in some very insecure environments. In 2017, therefore, we increased our HQ Security/Duty of Care unit by 50% (including, for the first time, a medical adviser), which enables us to monitor Mission security from a HQ perspective. Additionally, we reinforced our security policy by revising core publications such as the Field Security Handbook. eeas.europa.eu/topics/common-security-and-defence-policy-csdp/5438_en 31 More information: Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) Avenue de Cortenbergh/Kortenberglaan Bruxelles/Brussel - Belgium European Union Military Staff (EUMS) Avenue de Cortenbergh/Kortenberglaan Bruxelles/Brussel - Belgium View more Similar documents CSDP Civilian Missions.

Es una nueva forma de esclavitud moderna que atormenta a millones de seres humanos sobre la faz de la tierra y no parece estar destinada a desaparecer, sino todo lo contrario: se estima que hay mas de 40 millones de personas en esta condicion, y el numero va en aumento. Es que, en este sistema economico globalizado, la Trata es el segundo negocio ilicito mas rentable del mundo. Los culpables no aparecen en los grandes medios de comunicacion, nadie los conoce, no parece haber justicia a la que se deban someter. Es asi como los poderosos disponen de los cuerpos y las libertades de mujeres, hombres, ninas y ninos para maximizar sus ganancias, ya que el fin de este negocio es principalmente la explotacion laboral en el mercado ilegal de trabajo: explotacion sexual, trabajo infantil y venta de ninos son los destinos preferidos de los senores del mundo para sus victimas. La problematica se profundiza en un mundo sumido en una crisis estructural y civilizatoria, donde millones de personas deben abandonar su tierra por conflictos belicos o falta de oportunidades laborales para sostener a sus familias, lo que genera flujos migratorios nunca antes vistos: 244 millones de migrantes se contabilizaron en 2015. Los responsables siguen siendo los mismos: aquellas clases capitalistas que concentran, cada vez en menos manos, las riquezas. Es claro que las personas que caen presas de la red del trafico de personas siempre provienen en primer lugar de los sectores vulnerables, sumidos en condiciones de maxima pobreza, provenientes en su mayoria del sector rural, y principalmente las mujeres y los ninos. Los paises de la periferia son la tierra de origen de los y las esclavas, pero el fenomeno se extiende y se ven afectadas tambien las fronteras de las potencias mundiales. En relacion al sector rural en particular, es donde -segun la Organizacion Internacional del Trabajo (OIT)- se concentra el 75% de los pobres en el mundo. En la region, la pobreza entre la poblacion rural bajo solo de 62 % a 49% durante la ultima decada (2002-2011), pese al aumento de las agroexportaciones, al auge agricola y al crecimiento economico registrado por America Latina. Los proyectos politicos neoliberales al frente de los estados nacionales agudizan la desigualdad y sumen a estos sectores en las condiciones mas indignas de vida, protegiendo solo los intereses de las grandes corporaciones financieras y poseedoras de la tierra. En Argentina, desde la asuncion del gobierno de Mauricio Macri -previo fallo de la Corte Suprema que declaro inconstitucional la creacion del Registro Nacional de Trabajadores y Empleadores Agrarios-, la Procuraduria de Trata y Explotacion de Personas (protex), que asiste a las fiscalias en las causas sobre secuestro extorsivo, trata de personas y explotacion laboral, dejo de recibir las denuncias por trata de personas en la actividad rural. Es asi como miles y millones de trabajadores quedan desposeidos de marcos regulatorios y entidades que salvaguarden sus derechos humanos fundamentales de la mano de los grandes poderosos y sus empleados locales. El desafio es pensar como generar acciones colectivas que tengan la fuerza para exigir que tanto los gobiernos nacionales como los organismos internacionales garanticen las condiciones dignas de vida, con pleno cumplimiento de los derechos humanos de las mayorias, y dejen de responder a los intereses de las clases economicas dominantes.

Libyan coastguard vessels intercepted two of the migrant boats, the first an inflatable dinghy that had broken down with 125 people on board off Zawiya, just west of the capital, Tripoli, said Ayoub Qassem, a coastguard spokesman. The second boat was turned back off Garabulli, east of Tripoli, and had 112 people on board. One boat with 110 migrants on board made it as far as a rescue ship operated by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) operating about 21 miles from the coast west of Tripoli, which was preparing to deliver the migrants to Italy. More than half the migrants on that boat were Nigerians, with the rest from other sub-Saharan African countries as well as two Palestinians. Meanwhile the coastguard in Zuwara, a former Libyan smuggling hub west of Zawiya, said they had foiled a departure during the night and arrested some migrants whilst others had escaped with smugglers. The coastguard posted pictures of detained sub-Saharan African migrants sitting in an inflatable rubber boat on the beach in the dark. Libya is the main departure point for migrants attempting to reach Europe by sea. More than 600,000 migrants have crossed the central Mediterranean to Italy over the past four years as people smugglers took advantage of a security vacuum in Libya. Since last summer the rate of departures dropped significantly after smugglers in the Libyan town of Sabratha struck a deal with the Tripoli government to halt their activities and were then pushed out of the town by rival armed groups. Libya's EU-backed coastguard has also stepped up interceptions, often cutting migrant boats off before they can reach international vessels that would bring them to Europe.

Are you planning a trip there anytime soon? Posted on October 18, 2016 by jazzy800 Experience the joys of multiculturalism. You can get some great deals on airfare and hotels in Paris, especially now that tourism is down so much. Face of a dying Nation This footage, taken with a hidden camera by an anonymous Frenchman in the Avenue de Flandres, 19th Arrondissement, near the Stalingrad Metro Station in Paris as well as areas in close proximity, shows the devastating effects of uncontrolled illegal mass immigration of young African males into Europe. The streets are littered in garbage, the sidewalks are blocked with trash, junk and mattresses, thousands of African Muslim men claim the streets as their own - they sleep and live in tents like homeless people. If no portable toilets are in reach, open urination and defecation are commonplace. Tens of thousands of homeless illegal alien Muslims waiting for a decision of their asylum application, waste away trying to pass the time in the city. The police have given up trying to control these areas, the remaining French people avoid the areas at all cost, crime and rape is rampant, just recently mass brawls and riots made the news as fights broke out near the Stalingrad metro station.

A nice round number, right? It refers to the dead and missing in the central Mediterranean, mostly between Libya and Italy, in the first three months of 2017. The known dead died from drowning, exposure, hypothermia, and suffocation. Horrible, agonising deaths. 24,474. This is a nicer number. It refers to the women, men, and children who made it safely to Italy this year, all of them plucked from flimsy, overcrowded boats by European vessels. Many were rescued by teams from nongovernmental organisations patrolling international waters just off Libya, where most migrant boats depart. Those groups - including Doctors Without Borders (MSF, for the French acronym), Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS), SOS Mediterranee, Proactiva Open Arms, Sea-Watch and others - are now being accused of encouraging boat migration. Or worse, of collusion with people smugglers. The EU border agency, Frontex, has suggested that the presence of rescue operations by nongovernmental groups is a pull factor, encouraging people to take the dangerous journey in hopes of rescue. A prosecutor in Catania, Sicily, has opened an inquiry into the funding streams for these groups, indicating a suspicion that they may be profiting illicitly from the movement of people in search of safety and better lives. This is the latest cruel twist in the EU's response to boat migration from Libya. It reflects concern over increasing numbers of people embarking from Libya, the strain on the reception system in Italy and beyond, and the rise of xenophobic populism in many EU countries. But blaming the lifesavers ignores history, reality, and basic morality. As MSF's Aurelie Ponthieu explained, the NGO group rescuers are not \"the cause but a response\" to an ongoing human tragedy. Even before the significant increase in numbers in 2015, tens of thousands of people have been risking their lives in unseaworthy boats in the Mediterranean for decades; almost 14,000 have died or been reported missing since 2011. After the October 2013 Lampedusa tragedy, in which 368 people lost their lives, there was increased talk among organisations about mounting rescue missions in the central Mediterranean. In 2015, that became a reality, in large part because the end of the Italian navy's humanitarian rescue mission Mare Nostrum and the gaps in its poor replacement by the EU border agency Frontex. People embark on these dangerous journeys for myriad reasons; they are fleeing persecution, violence, and poverty, and moving toward freedom, safety, and opportunity. Both pull and push factors are always in play when people are on the move. Insofar as more freedoms, liberties, and policies grounded in respect for human rights - including vital rescue-at-sea operations - serve as pull factors, these should not be sacrificed in the name of limiting migration. The presence of EU vessels just off Libyan waters has changed the dynamic of boat migration. There is more hope of rescue, and smugglers have adopted even more unscrupulous tactics like using inflatable (throw-away) Zodiacs instead of wooden boats and providing only enough fuel to reach international waters. But to question the humanitarian imperative of rescue at sea is to discard our most basic respect for life. And the logic of those who criticise the rescue operations as a pull factor is that the groups should stop rescuing people and let them drown to discourage others from coming. That is no more moral than planting landmines on a border to discourage people from crossing it. It is telling, and encouraging, that the EU's naval Operation Sophia, an anti-smuggling operation named after a baby girl rescued by one its vessels in 2015, boasts of saving thousands of lives. The officers from numerous European navies deployed in the operation have participated in numerous rescue missions, and shepherded many exhausted, grateful people to safe harbours. Neither Operation Sophia nor Frontex have search-and-rescue at the core of their missions, but they are bound by the laws of the sea and the humanity of their crews to rescue those whose lives are in peril. There are steps beyond rescue that can mitigate the situation. Trapping people in unsafe countries like Libya is not the answer. But increasing safe and legal routes for refugees to seek protection in Europe and tackling the human rights abuse and poverty that drives migration can help. And in the meantime, there should be an end to recriminations and accusations and treating like criminals the rescuers working for charities, who are helping plug the gap left by EU member states. What is needed is more mutual trust, better coordination, and active EU patrols in locations where most boats enter into distress to ensure timely rescues.

TNN wishes to add more who's-who details. Begin by watching the video below. The \"rescuing on the seas\" narrative at this stage is a deception and a scam. This is industrial-scale human trafficking. They are making the whole trip, picking up passengers just offshore in Libya and ferrying them to Italy. The trafficker monitors are using Marinetraffic.com and Data.unhcr.org. Human traffickers contact the Italian coast guard in advance to receive support and to pick up their dubious human cargo. NGO ships are directed to the 'rescue spot' even as those to be rescued are still in Libya. The organizations behind this are: MOAS, Jugend Rettet, Stichting Bootvluchting, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Save the Children, Proactiva Open Arms, Sea-Watch.org, Sea-Eye and Life Boat. PHOTO: Bare Naked Islam The whole scheme is promoted online and even is offering an \"alarm phone number\" for smugglers and traffickers making their way. The voice in this video sounds American. The literature and information printed by the traffickers can be viewed here. Since the Italian coast guard does nothing to stop this, it must be presumed they are being bribed, heavily compromised or, at minimum, are highly negligent. These actions are criminal as few of these migrants are not eligible for asylum. However, the EU has created loophole legislature to protect people traffickers against prosecution. A dedicated section of an EU resolution entitled \"On Search and Rescue\" states that \"private ship masters and non-governmental organisations who assist in sea rescues in the Mediterranean Sea should not risk punishment for providing such assistance.\" These are not sea rescues. So that Europeans can take action, hold people accountable and build criminal cases or complaints against these actors, here are the websites of the NGOs. The names and locations can also be determined as well as contact information. The Italian coast guard site is here (in Italian). Italian citizens should make inquiries in their own language and use the Gefira tracking information to make the case. Of course, you can also go over the heads of the coast guard, if you believe they are corrupt. For instance, after the cargo is trafficked, you will see (in the case of Jugend Rettet) that most of the team and ambassadors are located throughout Germany, which is the end destination for most African illegals. In Germany you can see them loitering everywhere in public spaces, conducting little shakedowns aka aggressive begging, pimping, and selling drugs. MOAS is run by an American Christopher Catrambone and his Italian wife, Regina, out of Malta. According to the Zero Hedge source, the MOAS organisation has close links with the famous U.S. military contractor Blackwater and the U.S. Army. The board and staff of the Boat Refugee Foundation (Stichting Bootvluchteling) is located in the Netherlands, Postbus 360, 3500 AJ Utrecht, info@bootvluchteling.nl. The staff is laid out by name, and this group is largely operating in Greece. This is website of MSF out of the UK. Save the Children's website advertises itself as assisting African children in place, an honorable objective. However, they also run a ship in the Mediterranean. Trafficker Proactiva Open Arms can be found here. Sea Watch is running two ships. It is located in Berlin and also lobbies for open border regimes. Sea Eye is headquartered out of Regensburg, Germany. They had two boats, but one was confiscated by the Libyan government. The last trafficker, Life Boat, is again out of Hamburg, Germany, and is running one sea craft.

We must prepare for war with the Israeli defense forces. Failing that, we must enlist natives against the English in the English colonies, as they are the only whites who love the jews more than the white race.
