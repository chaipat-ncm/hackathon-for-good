Context of the 2018 NATO-Industry Forum The NATO-Industry Forum 2018 takes place against the backdrop of an uncertain and complex security environment, in which rapid advancements in technology have revealed new security frontiers and exposed the Alliance to increased threats from state and non-state actors. The rapid pace at which technology is advancing and diversifying increases the Alliance's demand on traditional and non-traditional defence industries for innovative solutions to multidimensional threats. For industry to contribute effectively to NATO capabilities, they require an understanding of the Alliance's plans and vision, an idea of the budget likely to be available and an indication of the commitment to pursue innovative solutions. The NATO-Industry Forum invites industry leadership from across the Alliance to engage in in-depth discussion about NATO's capability requirements, the capability development process and overall adaptation of the Alliance to embrace innovation and meet the challenges of today's world. The 2018 NATO-Industry Forum In the context of the growing number of capabilities that make it feasible for competitors to challenge the Alliance politically, militarily and technologically, this year's NATO-Industry Forum will focus on Innovation and Emerging & Disruptive Technologies. Participants will strategize on how to harness emerging and disruptive technologies for integration into NATO's current capability requirements and programs. Discussions will focus on NATO's business model for the engagement with industry, and will aim at identifying changes required to adapt and project the Alliance into the future. On Day 1 of the 2018 NATO-Industry Forum, participants will engage in round-tables discussions of their choice on: Logistics & Sustainment Enhanced Military \"Decision-Making\" Disruptive Technologies Autonomy The day will conclude with a reception hosted by the German Ministry of Defence. Day 2 will commence with keynote remarks by: H.E. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General Dr. Helge Braun, Head of the Federal Chancellery and Federal Minister for Special Tasks Gen. Andre Lanata, Supreme Allied Commander Transformation The day will continue with three plenary sessions, featuring prominent leaders in industry, and addressing: Innovation and Disruptive Technologies Policies and strategies for 21st Century Capabilities NATO and Industry - Ready for Novel Challenges The NATO-Industry Forum is sponsored by the NATO Secretary General, and co-organized by the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation and the Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment. The Forum welcomes prominent leadership from industries across the Alliance, as well as senior representatives from Allied nations and the European Union.

His family can be traced back to the early 18th Century when his family resided in Cleator, Cumberland, not far from the home town of Thomas Henry Ismay He was the a son of Sir Stanley Ismay, a member of the Viceroy's Legislative Council and later chief justice of the court in Mysore in the state of Kamataka, India. In 1921 he married Laura Kathleen Clegg, together they had three daughters. On 14 January 1947 Lionel was made a Baron, taking the title Baron Ismay, of Wormington, Gloucester and his wife received the title Baroness Ismay. Ismay was known throughout his life as Pug because of his heavy, bulldog jaw. During his military career and especially during WW2 he was often referred to as Pug to disguise his identity. Having always wanted a military career, he was educated at Charterhouse, and the Royal Military College Sandhurst. He was first commissioned in the Gloucestershire Regimen in 1905, but two years later served in the 21st Calvary (Frontier Force) in India. He served there until 1914, when he was seconded to the King's African Rifles. He served during 1917-1919 with the Somaliland Indian contingent and during 1919-1920 with the Camel Corps, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order granted for meritorious or distinguished service by officers of the armed forces during wartime, typically in actual combat. In 1921 he met and soon married Laura Clegg, the only daughter of Henry Gordon Clegg, of Wormington Grange, Worcestershire, during a leave on medical grounds. Their first daughter was born the next year, the other two a few years later. Lewin calls Ismay an 'unashamed bon viveur, who also enjoyed racing and polo, tennis, and bridge'. Indeed, Ismay recounts that he devoted 'more time to polo than to soldiering' when he was stationed in Rawalpindi (Ismay 1960: 39). In 1921, he passed through the Staff College, at Quetta, India, with distinction. Then, after a period as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster of the Army in India, he served from 1926-1930 as Assistant Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence. In 1931, he returned to India as the Military Secretary to Lord Willingdon, Viceroy and Governor-General of India. He came back to London two years later and served in the War Office. From 1936 to 1938 he was Deputy Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence under Secretary Maurice Hankey. On 1 August 1938, Ismay became Secretary of the Committee himself and began planning for possible British war involvement. In May 1940, when Winston Churchill became Prime Minister and Minister of Defence he selected Ismay as his chief staff officer to head a small, carefully selected secretariat. Throughout the Second World War, Ismay was responsible for dealing with Churchill's draft orders and minutes, the repository of his most secret matters, and had to be ready to depart on short notice on important missions abroad, including almost all of the wartime conferences. He became a lieutenant general in 1942 and full general in 1944. After the war, Ismay remained in the Army for another year, assisting in the reorganization of the Ministry of Defence. In 1945, he was awarded The Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) for service of conspicuous national importance. In 1946, Clement Attlee, the new Prime Minister, thought that Ismay's services had not been sufficiently recognized and, in 1947, he was made a Baron. Ismay retired from the Army effective 31 December 1946, but when Lord Louis Mountbatten was appointed Viceroy of India he insisted on having Ismay as his Chief of Staff. From 1948-1951, Ismay worked with Mountbatten, but he did not enjoy this time in India. He did not feel the same attachment to Mountbatten that he had for Churchill and he did not sympathize with the policy of partition. Moreover, he was unsuccessful in persuading the leaders of India and Pakistan not to divide the Indian army immediately and in his call for a referendum in Kashmir over whether it would join India or Pakistan. He declined the grand cross of the Star of India. When Churchill again became Prime Minister in 1951, be appointed Ismay as Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. The same year he was appointed to the Privy Council. Even though Ismay was responsible for Commonwealth relations, Churchill continued to seek his advice on defence matters. Ismay only held this office, which he enjoyed and did not want to relinquish, for six months and then was selected to be the first Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in spite of his age (65), the fact that he was suffering from fibrositis (fibromyalgia) and had been quite public with his belief that NATO was inadequate for the challenges of the Soviet Union. He had characterized NATO as 'too much harness and too little horse' He also thought of himself as lacking in diplomatic experience and 'too tired to provide the initiative and original thought which were called for' (Ismay 1960: 461). However, Ismay's selection for the newly created position solved a dilemma, as Sir Oliver Franks, British Ambassador to the United States (US) had turned down the position and the Canadian government had refused to make Lester Pearson available. Ismay assumed office on NATO's third anniversary, 4 April 1952. Although he was not the first person identified for the position, 'he came to NATO with greater practical experience in administration and government, of the meshing of military and civilian machinery, than any other man on either side of the Atlantic' As the first NATO Secretary-General, what Ismay did in office significantly shaped the various roles he needed to fill: alliance spokesperson, North Atlantic Council (NAC) vice-chair, initiator of ideas, mediator, conciliator, negotiator, administrator and international diplomat (Jordan 1979: 13-14). He was, for example, responsible for staffing and defining the scope of the Alliance's various divisions: Political Affairs, Production, Logistics, Economics, Finance, Information, Financial Controller, and Statistics. As a civil servant, who was a product of the British cabinet system, he saw his primary responsibility as developing an effective administrative organization built on the foundation of a genuine international civil service. He is also credited with a number of key organizational achievements, including the completion of 133 airfields, joint production programs, and the building of a petroleum pipeline and other related NATO infrastructure programs, essential to Western European defence. Wingate (1970: 203) suggests that what might have been his 'greatest personal triumph' was getting all NATO members to commit to a long-term military build-up, holding the Soviets as far east as possible. Ismay believed that military authorities should be subordinate to the political authorities. Thus, one of his proudest achievements at NATO was the establishment of procedures by which the military authorities, from the Standing Group down, would coordinate their plans and programs through him to the Council and would operate in every way with the work of the International Staff Secretariat. While the process for effectuating this was not perfected by the time Ismay retired, his relationships with NATO's military leaders at SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe), and especially the Strategic Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), were consistently good. The first SACEUR, Dwight David Eisenhower, had been a wartime colleague. Moreover, probably because of Ismay's own military background, the staff officers of SHAPE headquarters found it easy to do business with him even after Eisenhower left' (Jordan 1979: 43). Ismay has also been credited with being sure that a US general would replace Eisenhower as the successor SACEUR. At the time, it had not been determined that the SACEUR would always be from the US, as tradition dictates today. But Ismay's private consultation with all of the ambassadors at NATO ensured that the choice of the Harry S Truman administration, Matthew B. Ridgway would be approved unanimously when Eisenhower left. Yet, while all of this is true, it must be taken into account that for most of the time Ismay held office, it was the SACEURs who were the dominant leaders in NATO (Hendrickson 2006: 18-19). Jordan (1967: 293) saw Ismay's greatest contribution as Secretary-General as 'the creation of an international climate in which political decisions could be taken by the Council with the least friction'. Perhaps most memorably, Ismay is acknowledged as the first person to say that NATO's purpose was to 'keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down', a phrase often repeated to explain why NATO was still needed long after the fall of the Berlin Wall. As Secretary-General, Ismay worked hard to influence world public opinion, but clearly was constrained because he could not engage in the public discussion of policy unless he had a Council mandate, and there was only limited coordination of national foreign policies while he was in office. Ismay also believed that NATO would be well served by having a regular NATO parliamentary meeting at which NATO decisions would be debated by such a quasi-legislative body. Although the debates would obviously focus on issues of defence, Ismay's vision of NATO was one that included the non-military aspects included in Article II of NATO's constitutive document, the so-called Canadian article of the Washington Treaty. However, there was very little accomplished in this arena because many other international organizations addressed those issues. Ismay himself singled out the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) in particular. His vision also included NATO as the venue for allied global planning, something that did not sit well with key member states. Ismay had more success in strengthening NATO's internal force planning procedures, but dealing with the most challenging of such issues, the finger on the nuclear trigger, was one where he did not get very far. He eschewed pressuring ministers or their governments. Ismay's method was to present his views quietly prior to Council sessions, and then have a national representative put his proposals on the floor, even though under Council rules he was empowered to do so himself. In speech and action, Ismay always insisted he was the Council's servant: 'Thus it will be seen that I am not a political Eisenhower or Ridgway. \"I cannot speak or issue instructions on my own authority. I can only speak in the name of the Council and on the authority of the Council. It is very right that it should be so\" (Press Statement, 18 October 1952). Ismay told the Council in May 1955 that he was thinking of retiring, but he received 'so heartfelt an expression of its desire that he should remain for at least another year, that he consented to do so (Jordan 1967: 81). His last days as Secretary-General were consumed with proposed troop cuts, most notably by the British. Ismay had made public his decision to resign by the time the troop cuts were announced and thus he no longer commanded the full authority of his position. Yet, he did speak out, saying that if the British rationale were financial, they should not try to augment that rationale by suggesting that troops could be supplanted by firepower, for that rationale could become contagious. A compromise was eventually worked out, but Ismay was not centrally involved in achieving it. Still Jordan concludes: 'It was a sad time at NATO - especially in the International Staff/Secretariat - when Lord Ismay retired' since they had confidence in and respect for him. Ismay, of course, did not succeed in all his endeavours as Secretary-General. For example, he wanted NATO to be involved in international affairs outside of the North Atlantic. Thus, in 1956, he sought to address the Greco-Turkish dispute over Cyprus, but both the British and Turks opposed NATO intervention. Accordingly, shortly after his retirement as Secretary-General, he declared that 'NATO must always have an agreed policy for dealing with developments outside the NATO area as they occur' something that did not formally happen until after the NATO bombing of Serbia. He also encouraged the alliance's major players to consult about tensions in the Middle East prior to the Suez Crisis. But the British and French involvement there was done covertly, without any prior Council discussion. Ismay subsequently emphasized the need for such consultation, resulting in the appointment of 'the Three Wise Men' (Lester Pearson, Halvard Lange and Gaetano Martino), whose report called for a strong Secretary-General, one who could formally propose methods to improve consultations within the alliance and who would also oversee all Council meetings. Revealingly, in Suez, Ismay felt betrayed when his personal friend US President Eisenhower criticized the British action. Indeed when the US voted against the British a second time at the United Nations Security Council, Ismay wanted to resign immediately. 'It did not seem possible for him to serve an international organization in which he had created and maintained unity of purpose, when America, as the dominant partner, was treating Britain as an outcast.' He was dissuaded from resigning by his wife. After his retirement from NATO in May 1957, Queen Elizabeth II invested Ismay as a King of the Garter, Britain's highest order. Already 70 years old at the time of his retirement and in ill health, Ismay was still appointed to the boards of several corporations, including the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation. He was also able to publish his own memoirs in 1960, having earlier assisted Churchill with writing his six volumes, The Second World War (1948- 1953). Interestingly, the major focus in Ismay's memoirs is on his service in the Second World War, arguing that to go into depth about his NATO years would require an additional volume. In 1963, Ismay was asked to assist Sir Ian Jacob in a review of the organization of the British military. Being ill, he was unable to contribute much to the review. He died at his home in December 1965. Because he had no male heir, his title expired upon his death. Dear Hastings Ismay, As you know these are hard times that we live. The soviets are trying to corrupt the world with communism. As you know Britain as well as many other countries such as the USA have banded together in the form of NATO to combat this evil that is affecting our world. But what is any power without an army? As prime minister of England I would like to ask you to become the first secretary general of NATO. We need a strong willed man with your military expertise to head the military operations. The soviets won't yield to political negotiations but instead must be stopped with military might. I know that you are growing old like the rest of us but your country needs a general like you to help us. So please help your country and the world by accepting this position. Sincerely, Winston Churchill.txtNew {word-wrap:break-word;text-align:start;} .txtNew_override-left * {text-align:left !important;} .txtNew_override-right * {text-align:right !important;}

The decision to allow the NATO to join the coalition against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq follows weeks of pressure on the two allies, who are wary of NATO confronting Russia in Syria and of alienating Arab countries who see NATO as pushing a pro-Western agenda. \"NATO as an institution will join the coalition,\" said one senior diplomat involved in the discussions. \"The question is whether this just a symbolic gesture to the United States. France and Germany believe it is.\" Flying to the NATO meeting in Brussels with Trump, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday it would be an important step for the Organization to join the U.S.-led, 68-nation coalition. \"I think they're going to support NATO joining and becoming a formal member,\" he said, referring to \"a couple of countries that are still thinking it over\" but not giving details. A senior French diplomat said Paris was ready to accept NATO joining, but that its role would be limited to training and intelligence, things allies were already involved in. \"We want to ensure that momentum (in the U.S.-led coalition) is not disturbed,\" the diplomat said. U.S. and other European officials want to show Trump, who called NATO \"obsolete\" because he said it was not doing enough against terrorism, that the alliance is responding. While Islamic State is on the verge of defeat in its Iraqi stronghold of Mosul and bracing for an assault against its de facto capital in Raqqa, Syria, U.S. officials are concerned fleeing militants could leave a vacuum that could prompt Arab tribal fighters to turn on each other to gain control. All 28 NATO allies are members of the coalition, but the alliance as a formal member could become more involved, contributing equipment, training and the expertise it gained leading nations against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has also made the case for a non-combat role for the alliance in Syria and Iraq. \"NATO joining the coalition will also provide a better platform for coordinating the activities of NATO allies in the fight against terrorism,\" Stoltenberg said. \"It sends a strong and clear message of unity in the fight against terrorism and especially in light of the terrorist attacks in Manchester,\" he said. A suicide bomber killed 22 people, including children, in an attack on a crowded concert hall in the English city on Monday. Some allies including Britain were keen for NATO to do even more, for example using its AWACS surveillance planes over Syria and running command-and-control operations. German and French opposition means that for the moment, only one plane will watch over Syria from NATO-ally Turkey's airspace to provide air traffic information to improve safety for planes. French government spokesman Christophe Castaner told reporters that President Emmanuel Macron would speak to Trump at their lunch in Brussels on Thursday and that he understood Trump's call for a greater NATO role in Syria and Iraq. \"The president will say that he is attentive to this (Trump's call), but to make clear that it is not about transforming NATO into the sole strike force against Islamic State,\" Castaner said.

Stern | March 2nd, 2016 Supranationalism and the EU The polymath philosopher, activist and Nobel laureate Bertrand Russell was a radical left iconoclast who made major contributions to mathematical logic and nearly every other discipline he touched. Many libertarians admire him, but one major disagreement stands out: In his later years he advocated world government in order to prevent the use of nuclear weapons and put a final end to war itself. Forty-six years after Russell's death, global superstates have grown in stature. The newcomer is the European Union (EU), which gradually emerged as a political and monetary union from its 1951 roots as the European Coal and Steel Community. The idea was to prevent war between Germany and France in the aftermath of WWII under the aegis of \"supranationalism.\" As Einstein noted, \"Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind,\" and \"I am against any nationalism, even in the guise of mere patriotism. Privileges based on position and property have always seemed to me unjust and pernicious, as did any exaggerated personality cult.\" Libertarianism is incompatible with nationalism. But how should we think about supranationalism? Will ceding national sovereignty to a higher political power reduce or compound the damage traditionally wrought by states? Is supranationalism a stepping stone to lasting peace and the ultimate dissolution of states? Or might the concentration of power under Pax Europeana lend only a false sense of security, only to be overturned when a violent demagogue takes power in Brussels? National politicians have been wise not to cede military sovereignty, but the option will always be on the table. But now several countries want to leave the EU -- it's a mess. My Own Experience at EU Institutions I recently visited the ruling institutions of the nascent European superstate, the European Union (EU). These include the European Court of Justice (their Supreme Court) located ironically in uber-corrupt Luxembourg, plus NATO and the European Commission in Brussels. I was briefed by senior officials and bureaucrats. I listened with an open mind to all the cases presented by EU/US officials, but I remain unconvinced of the wisdom of many EU policies. The EU seems like a measure to centralize control in order to make it easier for business to co-opt European politicians who are now located in one place -- rather than deal with thousands of politicians in each nation's capital city. Akin to stationing all US lobbyists in Washington D.C., rather that at every state capital. The structure of the European Commission and its affiliated institutions is sufficiently labyrinthine to deter democratic accountability. Certainly there are good reasons to coordinate national policy in Europe, like environmental protection, reduced barriers to trade and investment, and law enforcement. But these benefits may not outweigh the costs of centralization of power, where it is at risk of corruption. Fortunately, military sovereignty has not been ceded yet (recall the Freedom Fries incident when France and others refused to invade Iraq with NATO). NATO, by the way, exists as a counterweight to Russia. And Russia justifies their \"aggression\" as a counterweight to NATO. Round and round we go. One recent development threatens to rip apart the EU: \"the migrant crisis.\" These people are \"refugees,\" but the EU doesn't call them that because it would grant the refugees special legal protections, such as being treated with the dignity deserved by all human beings. The refugee crisis resulted from Western activities in the MENA region. The political instability which resulted from military excursions over the last decade gave way to the conditions that have caused millions to leave their homes for Europe. The public's xenophobic response and politicians' failure to integrate the migrants has been disgraceful. The idea of the EU itself is a noble aspiration. Like many, I support the elimination of borders and use of a common currency as welcome moves away from the nationalism that ravaged the continent for a couple thousand years. But these are mere concessions for what I suspect is the actual purpose of the monetary union. The Troika Is Robbing Peripheral Europe The Troika is composed of the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, the European Commission (EC) in Brussels, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington D.C. These entities owe allegiance more to investment banks than nations. The creditor of ailing European states, the Troika is technocratic and has the upper hand intellectually and financially. Member states being unable to control their own currency has led to serious problems that can, according to the EU, only be solved by direct transfers of money from states which benefit from strong currency (Germany and Northern Europe) to those which are hurt by such a monetary regime (Ireland, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe). This is like the US model, where tax revenues from New York and California help fund Alabama and New Mexico. It is the \"United States of Europe,\" a fiscal federation model. Regardless of whether this is a desirable structure vis-a-vis sovereignty and democratic accountability, it is unlikely to be enacted due to continuing nationalism, e.g., the Brexit (Britain) or Grexit (Greece). Odious government debt should either be defaulted upon, or states must leave the monetary union to devalue their currencies. Otherwise, it will strangle economic wellbeing for decades to come. By endorsing Burns and Kotlikoff's The Coming Generational Storm, Fed Chair Janet Yellen herself acknowledged the US will ultimately need to inflate away or default upon their debt, which sits well over 100% debt to GDP ratio. The current austerity regime has not, and will not, work (it was likely not intended to work) due to the following economic dynamic: Austerity involves raising taxes and lowering state spending. That curtails GDP growth. This is uncontroversial in Keynesian economics, the dominant albeit imperfect model. Tax revenues are always a percentage of GDP. Shrinking GDP reduces tax revenue. This reduces the state's ability to meet interest payments on floating interest rate debt. This floating rate goes higher and higher as uncertainty mounts -- a positive feedback loop. It is a self-fulfilling prophesy. The Troika (IMF, ECB, EC) offer short term solutions (loans) in exchange for increasing austerity measures. This exacerbates the original problem. Financial assets, real estate, and state-owned assets trade at a discount and banks and investors benefit from fire-sale prices while the public, who had little role in the cause of the debt crisis, are the ones who suffer. The end result is a wealth transfer to financial institutions and wealthy investors followed by impoverishment of the public. This is not a recipe for a unified Europe. It is robbery. The same type that has been perpetrated by the IMF for decades in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This is not just my own view, but one shared by Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, the former chief economist at the World Bank. He described the above mechanism of neoliberal expropriation in his 2002 book, Globalization and Its Discontents. Unifying Europe requires repudiating the financial piracy perpetrated by the same banks that launder drug cartel money (e.g., HSBC), rig the most important interest rate in the world (LIBOR), and express gratitude for government bailouts by paying themselves eight-figure bonuses in the midst of a crisis that they caused. The Icelandic example could serve as a model, which included jail time for criminal bankers and nationalization of the banking system (not compatible with libertarianism, but neither is central banking). Iceland has recovered nicely while the rest of Europe remains mired in a deflationary debt trap. The EU may have been founded with noble intent. But it has been co-opted by the usual suspects (bankers, politicians) to serve as a sophisticated extortion scheme and mechanism to render a traditionally revolutionary and left-leaning continent \"more business friendly\" by weakening labor. I submit that member states should leave the Eurozone, default upon or devalue their debt simultaneously (most of the debt is already owned by the ECB), and the slate will be cleared. Big business can still transact in Euros, or the IMF's Special Drawing Rights to save on forex costs (that is, until they are replaced with worker cooperatives, God/FSM/Xenu willing). Until the debt is cleared, it will hang over the head Europe like guillotine blade. It is time that the people of Europe replace their heads with those responsible for, and profiting from, this protracted and artificial crisis.

The 54 million dollars facility is designed to treat 100 patients and offer a full range of physiotherapy services to military and civilian patients. According to NATO, the building would also provide living quarters for 20 female students attending the Afghanistan Academy for Medical Sciences. \"This facility is yet another example of the investment and commitment by NATO nations and partners to enable the Afghan government to provide necessary services,\" Cornelius Zimmermann, NATO Senior Civilian Representative in Afghanistan said. Providing medical care to Afghan National Army soldiers, police and their families, the Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan hospital is considered one of the best healthcare facilities in the country.

Tags: Balkan Follow NOVANEWS Adelina Marini Could Russia Recognise Kosovo? Is Serbia Preparing for Elections or a New Balance of Powers EU Has Lost Its Transformative Power. Enlargement Hits a Dead End A long delayed discussion took place in the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee about the tensions in the Western Balkans region, which have been growing for months now, but with the start of the new year the situation deteriorated dramatically. The discussion was initiated by the Slovenian MEP Ivo Vajgl (ALDE), who is the rapporteur for Macedonia, and was held on the day of the election of a new committee chairman. The former chairman, veteran of the European Parliament and Foreign Affairs Elmar Brok (EPP, Germany) conceded his post to another EPP MEP from Germany - David McAllister, who is the rapporteur for Serbia. A fact that was presented with a lot of hope by the Serbian media. During the hour-long debate the prevailing feeling was one of shared concern with the rising of tensions in the region, with just one differing opinion - that of the French nationalist Jean-Luc Schaffhauser of Marine Le Pen's Europe of Nations and Freedom group. The discussion was a very open and realistic analysis of events in the region. A thing that has long been missing at the European scene. According to David McAllister, the Western Balkans region needs to be a strategic priority for the EU, for the region is surrounded by EU member states and what goes on in it will have direct impact on the entire Union, especially in turbulent times. He read out a carefully prepared opening statement to the debate, in which he stated that the region is positioned in the heart of Europe. \"In almost all countries are growing issues such as incomplete reconciliation, fragile inter-ethnic co-existence, threatening Islamic radicalisation, Russia's growing influence, insufficient political dialogue, a lack of media freedom and socio-economic problems\". This realistic interlude was followed by pointing out of the hot spots, breeding tension in the region: the quarrel between Serbia and Kosovo because of the train issue; the post-election situation in Macedonia, growing ethnic polarisation in Bosnia and Herzegovina; claims about a coup attempt in Montenegro on Election Day and a possible manipulation by Russia. The Bosnia and Herzegovina rapporteur Cristian Dan Preda (EPP, Romania), who has long been warning about the Russian influence in the region, was even more straight-forward and direct. \"The interest that we are taking can be explained by 2 factors: we need to recognise the fact that there are serious crises of democracy in the countries across the region. The electorate continues to be attracted by what is called ethno-nationalist policies and the ethnic divides are still being fomented for electoral purposes, and campaigns would suggest that nationalist rhetoric dominates debate\", he started off. At the same time, he went on, Russia's influence is growing throughout the region, and in Russia itself the nationalist ethnic dimension of politics has active participation. The Romanian MEP even thinks it dominates. He warned that there is a clear and present danger that the region is quite volatile at the moment and admitted to the EU being partly to blame for that. The former Croatian foreign minister, now MEP of the Socialists and Democrats group Tonino Picula described two opposite processes, which are currently underway in the Western Balkans: their gradual progress towards European integration and the spreading of interests and values, which contradict European integration and values. He believes that the dividing lines are most of all within certain countries of the region. \"The region's progress is visible and undeniable, but it is not such, that it is immune to being threatened by a bad development, as we have been witnessing lately. Relations between Pristina and Belgrade, as well as the situation in Macedonia and BiH too are not safe enough, so that we could not witness a serious deterioration of interstate relations, which will reflect on their European integration path as well\", concluded Mr Picula. The initiator of the discussion, Ivo Vajgl, reminded that on the Balkans a conflict could burst into flame from a single little spark. \"All conflicts in this region started with verbal aggression. Hate speech and insults we hear a lot of these things currently - in the media, television, in the newspapers as well and unfortunately very prominent political figures in these countries have these comments\", he said. He believes the words of the Serbian president on the hapless train from Belgrade to Kosovska Mitrovica are capable of provoking war. Word is of the reinstatement of the Belgrade-Kosovska Mitrovica railway line for the first time in 18 years, which was however played out in a very provocative way. The train was painted on the outside in the colours of the Serbian flag and all over it, written in 21 languages, there were the words \"Kosovo is Serbia\". On the inside the train was pasted with photographs of frescoes from the Eastern Orthodox monastery in Kosovo. Due to the sharp escalation of tension the train was halted before it entered Kosovo, but let loose some militaristic rhetoric. The candidate for a second presidential term Tomislav Nikolic threatened that, if need be, he will send the military into Kosovo to protect the Serbian minority there. The rapporteur for Kosovo Ulrike Lunacek (Greens, Austria) urged the countries of the region to concentrate on European values. \"One of the essences of the enlargement process and what has made this EU strong is overcoming nationalist threats that brought to Europe in the last century the most ferocious wars we had\", she said and expressed her concern that the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States lends serious support to radical nationalists. She sees a solution to the problem in more television programmes and history textbooks, as well as in the ceasing of the politics of hate and violence. French MEP Jean-Luc Schaffhauser, however, was outraged at this type of speaking and asked whether among European values one should also consider the recognition of Kosovo, which he named \"a mafia state\". This caused some verbal discourse in the committee and forced Chairman McAllister's warning that such attitude is inappropriate. \"Please, let's treat all European states with the same respect\", called David McAllister. The debate was dominated by Croatian and Slovenian MEPs. Dubravka Suica (EPP, Croatia), who got elected Vice-Chairperson of the committee, believes that the problem of the region is the conformism of leaders in those countries. \"It is a fact that authoritarian tendencies and looking up at Russia present a great danger in these territories. There are authoritarian tendencies in existence, if we speak about the freedom of media in some states. Moreover, until we, as the EU, do not show willpower that we are ready to monitor political processes, the region will witness a further regress of democracy. The EU must be present much more actively in the region\", was her appeal. She believes that recent events are simply provocations, meant for domestic use and it is not likely that it will get to anything more serious, but only under the condition that the EU is more actively present in the region. Tanja Fajon (S&D, Slovenia) warned that the region suffers from growing nationalism and brain drain. Jozo Rados (ALDE, Croatia) reminded that, according to Serbia, the halting of the train was the provocation, not sending it. The president of Serbia stated that he was ready to go to war with Kosovo, just as he did in Croatia, reminded the MEP. \"Also, the EU has not been able to resolve problems in Macedonia for a whole decade. We have representatives of Kosovo going to Albania for consultations. So, we don't seem to be able to resolve the issues we are faced with. It seems that the political will is insufficient. Are we about to phase a new division of spheres of interest in the Western Balkans as we had in Yalta, just that we do not have the wisdom of Winston Churchill anymore\", further said Jozo Rados. Alojz Peterle (EPP, Slovenia), who used to be Slovenia's prime minister just at the time of its separation from former Yugoslavia, stated that the European context has changed significantly since the time of the declarations of Zagreb in the year 2000 and Thessalonnki of 2003. \"The question is whether we are satisfied with what is happening from one year to another\", he asked and requested a strong debate with the participation of the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini (Italy, S&D) and the Commissioner for Enlargement Negotiations Johannes Hahn (Austria, EPP). Romanian MEP Victor Bostinaru (S&D) explained the situation with the enlargement fatigue. \"The Western Balkans have been and will probably always be, if Europe is not wise to act, a place of confrontation among major international actors\", he said and called for EU member states of the region to have more active participation in the integration of their neighbours. \"If we continue with less effective steps than other countries, I'm referring to Russia, to China and Turkey they will be there\", warned the Romanian MEP. Another Croatian MEP - Marijana Petir (EPP) - criticised the EU's approach towards the Western Balkans. She believes it is not pro-active and, besides, double standards are being used. She gave Macedonia as an example, which had fulfilled all prerequisites for membership, but was left in the waiting room over the last 10 years. Petir called all member states to begin EU membership negotiations with Macedonia. \"At the same time, we seem to have a rather favourable approach when it comes to Serbia, irrespectively of Serbia's continuous proofs that it is not respecting the EU values\", added the Croatian MEP. On the same day as this debate was happening in the Foreign Affairs committee of the European Parliament, another round of the dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo took place at the highest level, in which on the Serbian side participated the Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic and President Tomislav Nikolic, and on the Kosovo side - President Hashim Thaci and Prime Minister Isa Mustafa. Nikolic's rhetoric remained unchanged even after that meeting, however. The next meeting of such rank is scheduled for Wednesday (February 1st). Meanwhile, the Croatian daily newspaper Jutarnji list published an interview [in Croatian language] with former Montenegro Prime Minister Milo Dukanovic, in which he warns that the Balkans may be described as a potential source of tension, due to the extremely tense relations between the East and the West. \"This could have catastrophic consequences for the region, especially keeping in mind that more and more countries are ethnically unstable and their once clear European perspective has become quite obscure in recent years\". Dukanovic also said that the agreement in the region, brought about by the Dayton peace accord no longer exists. \"Some remnants of the pre-Dayton crises, which were supposed to be eliminated, have remained intact; several new ones have appeared, like the blocking of Macedonia's road to integration. And now the perspective of the entire region looks quite worse and there are alternative ideas appearing already - generally already seen and proved false\", continues the former prime minister of Montenegro. He does, however, believe that the responsibility for the current state of affairs in the Western Balkans does not belong only to the international community, but also to the people living in the region. \"In life, I do not like situations where I have no alternatives, but this is how it is with the Balkans. The Balkans, sadly, have no instruments of their own for self-stabilisation. If we are to reach stability - and instability with us throughout history has always meant war - we need to create these instruments by entering a community of democratic, socially and economically more advanced countries than us\", is Milo Dukanovic's recipe.

Tags: NATO Follow NOVANEWS RT Eleven NATO countries have sent 4,000 troops to Lithuania, the largest Baltic nation, to participate in this year's Iron Sword exercises. The war games are meant to test the country's ability to rapidly deploy a large number of troops. The exercise, which started on Sunday and is set to last till December 2, involves training at two separate sites in Lithuania. \"This time poses new unexpected challenges before our military. We have to prepare units and their commanders to efficiently respond to conventional military threats,\" General Waldemar Rupsys, the head of Lithuania's Land Forces, told journalists ahead of the exercise. This year's Iron Sword maneuver, which is the third and, by far, largest held so far, involves almost 4,000 troops from the US, the UK, Germany, Canada, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Luxemburg, and the three Baltic states. The exercises held in the last two years had 2,500 and just over 2,000 troops participating, respectively. The troops will train to execute offensive and defensive operations, rapid deployments, and other tasks, Lithuania's Defense Ministry said. Iron Sword 2016 is Lithuania's first chance to test its new Zemaitija (Iron Wolf) brigade, which was formed earlier this year. It currently has two battalions and support units, but is to add two more battalions next year. The brigade consists of soldiers conscripted after Lithuania reinstated mandatory military service in March of 2015. NATO is placing additional military assets in Eastern Europe and conducting intensified training there, claiming that such measures are necessary to deter what it calls \"Russian aggression.\" However, Moscow denies threatening its neighbors and says the alliance is using the notion as a pretext to justify increased military spending and encroach on Russia's border. Lithuania, like some other European NATO members, is struggling to meet its obligation to spend two percent of its GDP on defense, but the government says it will be able to meet this benchmark by 2018.

Haass Aug 15, 2018 Turkey's currency crisis and standoff with the United States over the imprisonment of an American pastor have exposed the crumbling edifice of the two countries' Cold War-era partnership. Rather than hold out hope that Turkey will return to the Western fold, US and European policymakers must consider a new policy toward the country. NEW YORK - Now that Turkey is at loggerheads with its erstwhile ally, the United States, the country's currency crisis has morphed into a political problem of the first order. The immediate issue is Turkey's refusal to release the American pastor Andrew Brunson, who is being held on charges of terrorism, espionage, and subversion for his alleged role in the failed July 2016 coup against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The US government is right to object to Brunson's detention. But its reaction has been counterproductive. In particular, the imposition of additional US tariffs on imports of Turkish steel and aluminum could further undermine confidence in Turkey's economy, triggering a wider crisis that would do serious harm to the global economy. Moreover, tariffs allow Erdogan to blame his country's economic woes on America, rather than on his own government's incompetence. It is still possible that the Turkish government will find a way to release Brunson, and that US President Donald Trump, anxious to demonstrate fealty to the evangelicals who form a core part of his base, will rescind the tariffs. But even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the structural crisis in US-Turkish relations - and Western-Turkish relations generally - will remain. We are witnessing the gradual but steady demise of a relationship that is already an alliance in name only. Though the Trump administration is right to have confronted Turkey, it chose not only the wrong response, but also the wrong issue. .IRPP_ruby , .IRPP_ruby .postImageUrl , .IRPP_ruby .centered-text-area { height: 130px; position: relative; } .IRPP_ruby , .IRPP_ruby:hover , .IRPP_ruby:visited , .IRPP_ruby:active { border:0!important; } .IRPP_ruby .clearfix:after { content: \"\"; display: table; clear: both; } .IRPP_ruby { display: block; transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; width: 100%; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; background-color: #2C3E50; } .IRPP_ruby:active , .IRPP_ruby:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; background-color: #34495E; } .IRPP_ruby .postImageUrl { background-position: center; background-size: cover; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 31.59%; } .IRPP_ruby .centered-text-area { float: right; width: 65.65%; padding:0; margin:0; } .IRPP_ruby .centered-text { display: table; height: 130px; left: 0; top: 0; padding:0; margin:0; } .IRPP_ruby .IRPP_ruby-content { display: table-cell; margin: 0; padding: 0 74px 0 0px; position: relative; vertical-align: middle; width: 100%; } .IRPP_ruby .ctaText { border-bottom: 0 solid #fff; color: #3498DB; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: .125em; margin: 0; padding: 0; } .IRPP_ruby .postTitle { color: #ECF0F1; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600; margin: 0; padding: 0; } .IRPP_ruby .ctaButton { background: url(http://www.defenddemocracy.press/wp-content/plugins/intelly-related-posts-pro/assets/images/next-arrow.png)no-repeat; display: inline-block; height: 130px; width: 54px; } .IRPP_ruby .ctaButton { background-color: inherit; margin-left: 10px; position: absolute; right: 0; top: 0; } .IRPP_ruby:after { content: \"\"; display: block; clear: both; } Read also:Why one war when we can heve two!

Overnight our course material was changed and the enemy forces were no longer based on the Soviet order of battle. The Red Forces were replaced by mythical Pink Forces that we now fought our imaginary battles against on maps and table top exercises. I was quite intrigued because the enemy was no more the Warsaw Pact, so by extension the raison d'etre for North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) no more existed. I asked my German classmates and teachers, why were the Europeans still continuing with it when the threat was no more? Most replies that I got lacked clarity and conviction. I was told there were still common enemies like Saddam Hussain. A megalomaniac dictator with ambitions to make nuclear bombs that could be used against Israel. These allegations would ultimately prove false but would destroy Iraq in the process. The actual reason to defeat Saddam Hussain was to occupy his oilfields - the largest in the world. True to the predictions by my German friend, the first Gulf War was fought in 1991 to 'liberate' tiny Kuwait from Iraq. Thereafter the nature of warfare changed. On September 11, 2001, members of a shadowy organization called Al Qaeda struck on mainland United States and destroyed the Twin Towers in Manhattan and hit the building of the Pentagon in Washington DC. The age of terror had arrived in all its forms and manifestations. The US launched a counter offensive against the Taliban government in Afghanistan that had provided refuge to Al Qaeda's leadership. The mission to destroy Al Qaeda became the Global War against Terrorism. Along the way the Americans found it convenient to strike against Iraq once again to complete the unfinished business of dismantling the Baathist government and hang Saddam Hussain. Meanwhile in Afghanistan, an International Stabilization Force (ISAF) led by the US tried to steady the war wracked country. The ISAF was predominantly NATO. Seventeen years on, the war has not ended in Afghanistan and there are increasing signs of frustration because the resurgent Taliban continue to operate with impunity and control large swathes of territory. Another addition to this explosive cocktail is the presence of the local franchise of Islamic State (IS) in Afghanistan or Khorasan. While American diplomats and generals and the government in Kabul are thinking of actually talking directly with the Taliban, there are also signs that the NATO alliance is completing its life cycle. President Donald Trump has increasingly shown his annoyance with his European partners. The Meeting of the Group of 7 wealthy nations in Canada showed cracks. The iconic picture of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel leaning down and glowering at a pouting Putin sitting down in a chair as an unhappy child was a picture worth a thousand words. To add insult to injury, before leaving Quebec, Trump met his Canadian host Trudeau and used harsh words to berate him. The pressure was ratcheted up in the Brussels NATO conference, when Trump ordered his European allies to share a larger burden of defense. He wanted them to not just increase their defense spending but do it from 2 percent of their GDP to an unprecedented 4. In Britain he blasted the British Prime Minister, Theresa May for her pro-European policy after Brexit and praised her former colleague Boris Johnson for ditching her. There was more to come. Trump next went to Helsinki to meet the Russian President. There was a general expectation that Trump with his brash attitude would stand up to Putin and blame him for interference in the 2016 US election. No such thing happened and on his return Trump had to do a lot of explaining to his home audience. NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) foreign ministers attend a working dinner at the park of the Cinquantenaire during a NATO Summit in Brussels, on July 11, 2018. NATO leaders gathered in Brussels on July 11 for a two-day summit to discuss Russia, Iraq and their mission in Afghanistan. / AFP PHOTO / POOL / YVES HERMAN While Trump was seen as cozying up to the Russians he had declared a trade war not only against China but also against the Europeans and the Canadians. All this seems to have made the American foreign policy murky. The nuclear deal with Iran has been trashed and a new relationship has started with North Korea's Kim. The US Embassy has opened up in Jerusalem and in the Arab world the Saudis are firmly in his pocket. The world is changing at an alarming pace. Although NATO is not yet dying a premature death but if it does there will be a range of new alliances. The Russian, Chinese, Iranian and Pakistani intelligence chiefs have recently met to discuss the issue of the IS in Afghanistan. It was reported in the press in April this year that Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) would hold battle drills in the Urals in which Indian and Pakistani Special Forces would operate together. In the changing environment a number of questions come to mind. If NATO goes, would the Europeans make a defense alliance of their own? Britain and France have nuclear weapons but rest everyone else is dependent on the extended deterrence provided by the US. The Americans have bases in Germany, Japan and Korea. Would the US be decreasing its military footprint around the world? Would it be accepting the Russians as equal partners despite the annexation of Crimea? These are questions that should be agitating the minds of military and defense analysts the world over. New combinations and permutations need to be studied and implications for the region must be considered.

The event gathered more than 420 participants, including Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and senior managers from leading defence companies. Under the leadership of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, the Forum welcomed the participation of the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini and EU Commissioner for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship, and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME), Elzbieta Bienkowska, all three emphasising the need for strong and complementary NATO-EU cooperation. The level of attendance was unprecedented, with the number and the seniority of participation reflecting the increasing interest in the engagement and cooperation between NATO and Industry in the development of capabilities, which are needed to defend the core values of NATO, the EU, national governments and citizens. More than ever, the Forum proved to be a valuable and great opportunity for NATO, including national political and military leadership, to meet with industry, academia and think-tanks from Europe and North America. The Forum offered the chance to debate strategies and to define innovative solutions to capability needs that will enhance the Alliance s credibility, and ensure that NATO maintains its technical edge as a vital contribution to Trans-Atlantic security. Several directions of interest were identified throughout the day s debates such as the need for NATO to be a faster and more agile organisation, particularly in procurement; to deepen its engagement with industry; to work together with industry on the twenty-first century standardisation; to foster and capture innovation, and to develop more cooperation and dialogue within Europe and across the Atlantic. We would like to wholeheartedly express our appreciation to all participants, as well as to the Belgium authorities who supported this conference, in making it such a resounding success.

The opinions quoted in this report reflect the views of individual participants, and they are neither consensual nor necessarily represent NATO s position. 4 5 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Hosted by Belgium in the Palais d Egmont, Brussels, and jointly organized by the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT) and the Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment (ASG/DI), the NATO-Industry Forum (NIF) gathered more than 420 participants from Industry, including Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) from Airbus, Boeing, DCNS, Indra, Leidos, Leonardo, Lockheed-Martin, MBDA, Sabena Aerospace and Terma, as well as key policy-makers from the European Union, NATO and Nations. Key takeaways identified during the discussion include: Participants agreed that NATO should leverage industry s innovative capacity during the earliest phases of capability development. In particular, NATO should strive to increase its understanding of industrial possibilities, to position itself as a knowledgeable customer that knows what to ask of industry and how best to ask it. Industry indicated their interest to understand the long-term direction of travel for each NATO capability area, so that they are better positioned to take informed strategic investment decisions, to offer solutions when needed, and to contribute to addressing the challenges of Alliance transformation. NATO should further deepen its engagement with Industry through joint concept development, involvement in exercises, experimentation and war gaming, in order to design future solutions together. Sharing a problem statement with industry and then jointly considering the necessary elements allowing NATO to generate the requirements would potentially result in faster delivery, better and even more affordable capabilities to satisfy the military customer. In the specific area of Command and Control, the challenge of managing Big Data and the Federated Mission Networking concept were identified as central areas where industry and NATO must co-operate. The length of the NATO acquisition process was criticised. One-size-fits-all procurement strategies may no longer (in fact, already do not) address NATO needs adequately. Novel approaches have to be identified in order to inspire industrial innovation. Participants underscored that NATO must be faster and more agile in its procedures, to match the speed of the globalized security and business environment, and of technological advancements, both to counter threats and exploit opportunities. Beyond the obvious merits of standardisation (e.g. ease of integration, lower per-unit cost, etc.), participants noted the importance of engaging with industry as early as possible to foster interoperability by design. This could facilitate larger markets for the capabilities in question and improve efficiency of units operating together. Participants noted the challenges faced by innovative SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, which represent the majority of security and defence firms in most NATO nations) to be able to contribute with defence solutions. Industry participants invited NATO to develop simplified processes and procedures for SMEs, since the current acquisition system is geared to organisations that can sustain lengthy procurement cycles. The defence industry provides the equipment, the capabilities we need and you have actually provided us with the best equipment in the world and the most advanced capabilities in the world for decades. But we have to make sure that it continues to be like that in a more dangerous and more challenging security environment. And that is the reason why I welcome very much that we this year have the highest level of participation from industry ever at this NATO-Industry Forum reflecting the increased interest both from NATO and from the industry in how we can enhance our cooperation. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg address to NATO-Industry Forum6 REPORT Expectations from a NATO-Industry Forum NATO-Industry Forum represents the pinnacle of the Alliance engagement with the defence and security industry. By bringing together NATO, industry, EU institutions and national representatives for a strategic debate on the critical aspects of the engagement with the defence and security industry. NIF aims at creating an environment Maintaining a strong defenceindustrial base is an investment in maintaining peace in which strategic topics are debated by strategists, for a strategic audience expecting a strategic impact. The last three editions of the Forum have witnessed an increased interest in debating the fundamentals of multinational cooperation, of NATO capability development and of its engagement with industry. The decisions by the Heads of State and Government at the Chicago, Wales and Warsaw Summits have been echoed by high level debates in the NATO-Industry Forum. NIF builds a healthier and more structured NATO communication with industry, complementing other large events such as the NATO Communications and Information Agency s NITEC and NIAS events, and other alleys such as the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA), the Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) and its NATO Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) activities geared toward industry. Similarly it has elevated the more technically-focussed discussions in formats such as the Framework for Collaborative Interaction with Academia and Industry (FFCI), ACT s Innovation Hub and CNAD s subgroups to the attention of NATO, EU, and industry leadership. NATO-Industry Forum 2016 (NIF16) Drawing on the decisions from the Warsaw Summit and the Joint Declaration of the Presidents of the European Council and the European Commission, and the NATO Secretary General, the NIF examined questions related to reinvestment in defence and the predictability of defence budgets that impact the orientation of industry, the alignment between NATO transformation and industry strategic visions, and their impact on the future industry strategies for growth. General Marc Compernol, the Chief of Defence of the Kingdom of Belgium, and General Denis Mercier, the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT), opened the morning session highlighting the importance of the NATO-Industry Forum as the capstone event where NATO, and national political and military leadership meet with industry, academia and think-tanks from Europe and North America, to debate strategies to define innovative solutions to capability needs that will enhance the Alliance s credibility, and ensure that NATO keeps the technical edge, as a vital contribution to the Trans- Atlantic security. The morning breakout sessions, co-chaired by Allied Command Transformation and the NATO Industrial Advisory Group, examined Alliance capability priorities and command and control, including ways to improve joint NATO-Industry awareness of possible future needs and opportunities. Lieutenant General Jeff Lofgren, ACT Deputy Chief of Staff, Capability Development, together with Mr. Paul Donnie Gilley, Managing Director, Mission Development and Integration Corporate NATO is just as essential as it was 67 years ago when the North Atlantic Treaty was signed Engineering, Technology and Operations from Lockheed Martin Corporation, co-chaired the Breakout Session 1 on NATO Capability Priorities. This session explored ways to improve NATO and Industry mutual awareness of possible future needs and opportunities to improve the quality, effectiveness and availability of defence capabilities. The Session on NATO Command and Control (C2) addressed ACT s C2 Focus Area and the developing C2 Concept for 2030 and Industry engagement, and was co-chaired by a team composed of Rear Admiral Onder Celebi, Turkish Navy, ACT Assistant Chief of Staff, Command & Control, Deployability & Sustainability, Mr. Johan Goossens, Head of ACT Technology and Human Factors Branch, Mr. Leendert van Bochoven IBM Global Lead for National Security and NATO, Member of the IBM Industry Academy, and Mr. Marc Cathelineau, Senior Vice-President EU-NATO-UN, THALES. 67 The sessions were aligned with the general aim of the NIF to define ways to improve NATO s awareness of the technological opportunities, and in return, industry awareness of possible future military needs. Increased awareness on both sides is expected to stimulate NATO and industry to engage in more cooperation, to better harmonise requirements and investments, resulting in improved affordability and interoperability of the capabilities with a strong focus on C2 issues and federated networking. The afternoon session was opened with the State of the NIF report by General Mercier in which he recognised systems engineering as key in the development of future capabilities and the importance of enhanced relation with Industry on the road to transformation. NIF continued in the format of two plenary sessions, moderated by Catherine Herridge, FOX News Chief Intelligence Correspondent. The first session examined how NATO current and future capability development must push limits, drive change, and be proactive with opportunities for National and NATO capabilities, while maintaining the Alliance s warfighting edge. The second plenary session detailed strategies for global success as revealed by senior industry executives. Early Engagement of Industry in NATO Capability Development Participants agreed that NATO should leverage industry s innovative capacity during the earliest phases of capability development. This declaration confirms the importance of the Framework for NATO-Industry Engagement (FNIE), which has resulted in Industry having multiple points of entry to work with NATO. NATO strives to increase its understanding of industrial possibilities, in order to position itself as a knowledgeable customer, fully aware of what to ask from industry. This may require an evolution of the NATO-Industry relationship from the current, mostly transactional, model to a more strategic, continuous dialogue, capable of influencing NATO defence planning. While there has been progress in this area, significant work remains to be done. Diversifying the interaction with Industry, from solely defence Industry to security and even commercial markets, and bringing their views upstream into the concept development work an area where Industry traditionally has not participated would help bring innovation into Alliance transformation. Industry can help the Alliance develop future game-changing concepts and adapt the operational functions. By better working together in the capability development process as appropriate, the trust between NATO and Industry can be built and reinforced. Industry will have a better understanding of NATO priorities and in return NATO will benefit from innovative technologies and new ways of doing business. Industry s role in strategic foresight analysis, which is a precursor of the cyclical defence planning process, has already been explored and is valued. It could be further improved by including inputs from Industry strategists. The intent for the next NATO Strategic Foresight Defence industry is not selling products to customers it is delivering capabilities to sovereign countries Analysis update is to include key technology trends where contribution from Industry will be sought. ACT currently is identifying the appropriate mechanism to solicit strategic-level contribution from Industry, with a focus on technology, business processes, and human capital. Industry has indicated their interest in better understanding the long-term direction of travel for each capability area, which would allow them to adjust their investment plans to be better positioned to offer solutions, when needed, which address future Alliance challenges. Our priorities for investments are crucial for our countries as well, not only for the business. Several participants noted that developing a common lexicon and sharing threat scenarios would help ensure a common understanding between NATO and Industry. A more dynamic and open engagement with Industry, including non-defence companies, around the priorities of the Alliance, will remain essential to encourage technical and procedural innovation. Industry s early engagement in defence planning shall be inclusive, transparent and fair, without compromising future participation in any competitive procurement process. Industrialists expressed their difficulty to engage with NATO in pre-acquisition phase over classified information while such a dialogue exists within Nations to some extent. According to one industrialist The defence industry is not selling products to customers it is delivering military capabilities to sovereign countries conveying the view that the defence and the commercial markets are different and driven by distinct rules of which NATO has to be mindful. 78 The participants agreed that the majority of the capabilities are procured by the nations, therefore NATO should be seen as an opportunity to access the nations, as a window to nations. This implies that closeness to national ministries of defence is equally relevant for Industry as is the engagement with NATO. Improving NATO-Industry Common Understanding and Development of Joint Solutions My job as military is to go to war. Your job as industry is to make it easy for me. NATO should further deepen its engagement with Industry through joint concept development; involvement in exercises; experimentation and war-gaming; in order to better design future solutions. Sharing a problem statement with Industry and then jointly considering the necessary elements for allowing NATO to generate the requirements is anticipated to result in faster delivery, and better and more affordable capabilities to satisfy the military customer. We need to segregate the discussion on the current fight from the one on the future fight Alliance transformation recognises that future solutions will likely be based on networked systems of systems and based on open architectures. The engagement with Industry should include more experimentation and war-gaming to better understand how to optimally network these constructs to ensure military superiority. Participants specifically noted the importance of simulation and live-virtual-constructive training as a significant opportunity for increased NATO- Industry partnership. The ACT Innovation Hub was also mentioned as a cost-effective and efficient model for expanded NATO-Industry online collaboration. Industry noted the value of witnessing capabilities being operated and having the ability to offer immediate feedback, highlighting the usefulness of the Industry Involvement Initiative for NATO Exercises (I3X). The aim of I3X is to foster innovation by allowing Industry to gain an understanding of how NATO operates. We need to segregate the discussion on the current fight from the one on the future fight. In other words, we need to support and improve today s capability, while understanding and shaping the future, and bridging the two. In the specific area of Command and Control (C2), the challenge of managing Big Data and the Federated Mission Networking concept were identified as central areas where Industry and NATO must co-operate. In terms of managing Big Data, participants noted the enormous growth in available data and the importance of managing future data in a different way, incorporating machine learning and automation, as appropriate. The notion of cognitive command and control emerged during the discussion, referring to computer systems that have the ability to reason and learn from both human input and new data. Future C2 may rely more heavily on people and processes as the key differentiator between strong and weak C2. Innovation Innovation was a thread that transcended the entire debate at the NATO- Industry Forum. References were made to the Warsaw Summit text on innovation which represents an incentive to improve the triggering and implementation of innovative ideas, as well as their capture to support NATO transformation. Referring to the US Third Offset Strategy, participants understood its three main components: innovation; tactics, techniques and procedures; and repurposing the existing capabilities. It was mentioned that it will not undermine NATO interoperability, as some participants expressed concerns. We don t lack innovation neither in the military, nor in the commercial what we lack are resources to capture that innovation. We share the need to build a pipeline of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) talent so that we can continue to encourage innovation Increasing integration between the commercial and defence sectors is likely to help with constrained defence budgets and bring more innovation into defence. While recognising the relevance of non-defence companies for innovation, ways to attract and exploit non-defence knowledge and expertise for NATO should be considered. Panellists 89 recognised a need for improved horizon scanning, adapting innovation from non-defence sectors, and increasing Euro- Atlantic indigenous innovation. Harmonisation of Efforts It was recognised that for a significant number of Allies, the national defence procurement plans are heavily influenced by NATO. This influence should be seen as an opportunity to better synchronise national procurement strategies in terms of timing, harmonisation of the requirements and of investment calendars. NATO offers an ideal platform for nations to share/pool their efforts, in the context of the current shortage of defence budgets. The positive effects of the Defence Investment Pledge from the Wales Summit were welcomed, and considered as the precursor of more predictable and augmented defence investments. European Champions Competition is a way to acquire capabilities that are affordable and performing according to specifications. But you also need suppliers that have critical mass and the ability to invest in the long term. It has been estimated that for Europe to become a more credible defence supplier on the global market, and consequently a stronger pillar of NATO, Europe needs champions Industry that is competitive, which also has the critical mass able to sustain longer term procurement programmes. In Europe it is perhaps no longer possible to achieve that critical mass nationally in several capability areas. Therefore Competition, critical mass and partnering are key for smart and efficient procurement. Suppliers have to have critical mass and the ability to invest in the long term It was mentioned that even though the European defence market is currently fragmented, by initiating cooperative programmes, that fragmentation will diminish naturally and less painfully than if directed from the top. Commercial vs. Defence Industry Defence industry plays in a different market, which is driven by different sets of rules. The defence industry could improve its understanding of agile procurement. The concept of sell and forget does not stand anymore, the capabilities being required are to be serviced during their entire life cycle, and therefore parallels are often difficult to draw with the commercial world. Trans-Atlantic Defence Industrial Cooperation Concerns about protectionism and export controls emerged as themes that may prevent true Euro-Atlantic industrial integration. Participants recognized the need and value of Trans-Atlantic ventures to address defence and security challenges, and international competition. Industry participants noted a potential need for export reassurances to ensure sustainability. NATO-EU Cooperation The joint declaration signed on the occasion of the Warsaw Summit by the President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission, and NATO Secretary General was welcomed by participants who expressed expectations for a closer dialogue and cooperation between NATO and EU. Participants highlighted that the EU actions could strengthen the European pillar of NATO, which will inherently become stronger militarily. An action plan to define implementation elements of the provisions of the joint declaration was anticipated to be approved by the Foreign Ministers at their meeting in December 2016 [the Action Plan was approved on 6 December] 910 Improving NATO Agility and Responsiveness in Procurement Participants underscored that NATO must be faster and more agile in its procedures, to match the speed of the globalized security and business environment, and of technological advancements, to counter threats and exploit opportunities. Novel approaches have to be identified in order to inspire industrial innovation, not solely in technology, but by including different ways of thinking and conducting business. Some capabilities may be There is a need for consistent and sustained investment to support operational readiness NATO-owned but commercially operated, or NATO leased, or capabilities may be offered as services (CaaS - Capability as a Service). Both NATO and Industry must strive to deliver capabilities that are innovative at the time they are delivered and start being operated, mindful of the fact that the NATO common acquisition process was not engineered for speed. Panellists discussed the investment malaise of European nations to fund defence, as one of the core difficulties of NATO transformation. There was general agreement that technological and military superiority can no longer be taken for granted, thus reinforcing the need for sustained and coordinated defence investment, especially with the European Union. EU HRVP Mogherini noted that a strong NATO makes Europe safer and EU Commissioner Bienkowska announced that the EU Commission will act as a facilitator to improve defence cooperation with NATO, including as part of the European Defence Action Plan [launched on 30 November 2016]. The length of the NATO acquisition process was criticised by many participants. In a very dynamic world a one-size-fits-all procurement strategy no longer adequately addresses NATO needs. Standardisation and Interoperability Beyond the obvious merits of standardisation (e.g. improved interoperability, ease of integration, lower per-unit cost, etc.), participants noted the importance of engaging with industry as early as possible to foster interoperability by design, and not as an after-thought. This could also facilitate access to larger markets for the respective capabilities. Standards facilitate the reuse of solutions and of investments Several participants noted the importance of NATO defining the standards before the commercial sector or before other countries define them. Increasing standardisation can reduce the cost of new developments and provide openings for innovation to emerge. Some participants cautioned that increasing standardization might hinder competition by limiting the number of companies that can participate in capability development as being standard compliant. The importance of standardisation at the right level was raised, using standards to define the data highways to connect different systems rather than standardising the systems themselves. Standardisation was also seen as levelling the defence industrial playing field and stimulating competition. NATO s undisputed role in standardisation makes it the ideal catalyst to generalise standards, through for example the Federated Mission Networking, for the benefits of Allies and Partners. In an environment characterised by fiscal austerity, system complexity, and cooperative operations, NATO plays a critical role, particularly for the standardisation of technical concepts, techniques, procedures and doctrines. The direct connection between NATO decisions and national procurement makes it essential for an improved Industry understanding of NATO s priorities and transformational efforts, while recalling that the majority of capabilities are still produced and provided by nations. Outreach to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) Standards facilitate the reuse of solutions and of investments SMEs are commonly seen as more flexible than large companies, and can quickly respond to new or changing requirements. Moreover, SMEs are particularly well-positioned to invest in advanced and innovative capabilities, especially those at the end of the supply chain such as high-technology equipment for command and control. Finally, it is important to develop a mechanism to draw innovation from SMEs into larger defence companies, especially cross border. 1011 SMEs could also play a role in NATO s transition from risk avoidance to risk management, as they are the perfect place to test new ideas and conduct experiments due to the low cost and ability to quickly readjust or abandon an idea, as necessary. Participants noted the challenges faced by SMEs, which represent the majority of security and defence firms in almost all NATO nations, to be able to contribute to defence solutions. In particular, SMEs face difficulties related to the supply of financing in terms of both quantity and speed. Therefore, NATO and Nations could attempt to simplify processes and make it easier and more rewarding for SMEs to participate in capability development. Some participants noted the challenge of identifying a concrete business opportunity, which prevents companies (often SMEs) from committing resources in the pre-acquisition phase. NATO was invited to develop a stronger link between the pre-acquisition and acquisition phases while respecting the separation of the two. NATO recognizes the challenge faced by SMEs and is looking to develop small, focused events that concentrate on a specific transformation focus area to help SMEs identify concrete business opportunities. Additionally, ACT has established a permanent Brussels point of contact for its Office for Collaboration with Academia and Industry (OCAI) to facilitate contacts with European industry, and is looking to further expand this European footprint in collaboration with the Defence Investment Division at NATO HQ. SMEs can develop up to prototype then the prime can scale it up NATO should develop simplified processes and procedures for SMEs, since the current acquisition system is geared to organisations that can sustain long procurement cycles. An SME can develop up to prototype then the prime can scale it up. The Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment, Mr. Camille Grand closed the 2016 edition of the NATO-Industry Forum by thanking the Belgian authorities for hosting the event in an outstanding venue. With the promise of a fully-fledged report, he mentioned several directions of interest identified throughout the day s debates: NATO to be a faster and more agile organisation, particularly in procurement; to deepen the engagement with industry; to work together with industry on the twenty-first century standardisation; to foster innovation, and possibly to develop a common innovation plan to support this initiative. He also encouraged more cooperation and dialogue within Europe and across the Atlantic. The discussions reinforced the value of dialogue with Industry at all levels. NATO will only be able to continue to provide deterrence, crisis management, and collective defence if it continues to have a strong defence industry. NATO and Industry play complementary roles maintaining and developing the most advanced capabilities for the challenging security environment. A list of actionable items have been identified from the very fruitful discussion, and will be taken forward by ACT and the Defence Investment Division. The status of their implementation and/or impact will be reported as appropriate.

For the Alliance to keep its technological edge, it is of particular importance to support innovation with the aim to identify advanced and emerging technologies, evaluate their applicability in the military domain, and implement them through innovative solutions. In this regard, NATO welcomes initiatives from both sides of the Atlantic to maintain and advance the military and technological advantage of Allied capabilities through innovation and encourages nations to ensure such initiatives will lead to increased cooperation within the Alliance and among Allies. Warsaw Summit Communique - July 2016 Alliance Challenges Today, the Alliance faces a range of security challenges and threats from 360 degrees around its periphery; from state and non-state actors; from military forces and from terrorist, cyber, or hybrid attacks. Our security is deeply affected by the security situation in the Middle East and North Africa, which has deteriorated significantly across the whole region. The challenging security environment of today, and continuing into the foreseeable future, requires the Alliance to accelerate the delivery of innovative, interoperable and integrated military capabilities to secure military superiority. Industry plays a critical role in Alliance transformation as a foundation of Alliance credibility. At the 2014 Wales Summit, NATO recognized the need for future-focused adaptation, politically, militarily and institutionally. The Alliance not only acknowledged new security challenges, but also proactively adopted measures intended as game changers for the future. One year later, NATO issued the Framework for Future Alliance Operations (FFAO), a comprehensive analysis of possible future threats. FFAO identifies five Strategic Military Perspectives offering broad guiding principles to inform the NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP): operational agility, security networking, shared resilience, strategic awareness and strategic communications. All are seamlessly integrated in the Alliance adaptation effort and all are linked to the NDPP headings: prepare, project, engage, sustain, protect, inform and Command and Control (C2). Defence Investment Pledge The Wales Defence Investment Pledge, reaffirmed at Warsaw, is a commitment by Allies to reverse the trend of declining defence budgets, to move toward achievement of 2% of GDP for defence within a decade and to dedicate 20% of defence expenditures to new equipment and research and development. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), in 2015 there were signs that the austerity-driven decline in military spending in Western and Central Europe that has held since 2010 may be coming to an end. While military spending in Western Europe continued to fall (by 1.3 per cent in 2015), for the first time since 2009 the number of countries in Europe that increased expenditure was higher than the number of those that reduced spending. The three biggest spenders in Western Europe the UK, France and Germany have all signalled a growth in spending in the coming years and the projected aggregate of NATO- Europe spending on defence for 2016 is projected to increase by 1.5%. The Defence Investment Pledge has started to produce the desired results, though there is still a long way to go. After Warsaw The Warsaw Summit, 8-9 July 2016, was a key milestone for the Alliance. Allied leaders agreed to augment Alliance defensive capacity in the face of rising threats, including from hybrid warfare and a resurgent and unpredictable Russia. The main focus of the Summit was on strengthening the Alliance s deterrence and defence and also to project stability to NATO s wider neighbourhood. This reinforcement of the commitment to deterrence and collective defence provides a strategic direction for the Alliance. At Warsaw, Leaders decided to strengthen the Alliance s military presence in the east. They also agreed to develop a tailored forward presence in the south-eastern part of the Alliance. Allies declared Initial Operational Capability of NATO s Ballistic Missile Defence, pledged to strengthen their national cyber defences, and recognised cyberspace as an operational domain. Leaders agreed the importance of projecting stability through support for partners including agreement to start training and capacity building inside Iraq. Finally, NATO and the EU signed a joint declaration taking their partnership to an ambitious new level, including promotion of a strong defence industry and greater defence research and industrial cooperation within Europe and across the Atlantic. 1415 Capability Priorities Since NATO s inception, Allies have relied on strategic, operational, and tactical military advantage. Industry is a crucial contributor to Alliance s capability development and there is an increasing need to share innovation, identify new ideas, assess them and implement the most promising ones through appropriate national or multinational initiatives. However, the current security environment poses an increasing challenge for the Alliance to maintain its edge. This is, in part, due to the discovery, availability and innovative use of high- and low-end technologies by both state and non-state actors. New technology is globally available and is developing at a rapid-pace. Commercial technology is being adapted for military purposes, particularly in the areas of electronics, communications, and information technologies. While one may think of dual-use technologies by design, others re-purpose and re-direct existing technologies to a military application: e.g. the design and use of improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan and hybrid warfare tactics used in Ukraine and elsewhere are cases in point. Furthermore, advancements in connectivity make access to technological breakthroughs easier, faster and cheaper. The novel use of technology as well as the use of novel technologies, combined with the wider use of commercial and dual-use technologies, challenge the rhythm and the depth of traditional military technological advantages. These trends are not favourable to maintaining our military edge, nor are they likely to revert; what was once an element of deliberate strategy has, over the course of the last decades, evolved into a presumption of technological superiority. We are living in a world where a non-state actor can acquire sophisticated unmanned systems with which it can improvise weapons, making use of cloud computing and social media to assemble sophisticated command and control. This changing environment requires a fresh look at how new technologies are developed, and how existing technologies are employed. Additionally, national efforts and closer collaboration with Industry, aggregated at the level of the Alliance to identify necessary capabilities and pursue new technologies should become the norm. Of all the capabilities required, Command and Control (C2) is particularly critical since it is the glue that connects and synchronizes NATO, National, and Partner efforts. Despite decades of effort to advance interoperability, recent operations and exercises demonstrate that C2 challenges remain. Future C2 architectures will need to be designed for the emergence of big data and quantum computing, and shift from linking assets together to cloud-like systems of systems able to flexibly integrate future capabilities. This C2 vision reflects the developments in both defence and non-defence industries, thus offering a significant opportunity for closer NATO-Industry collaboration to solve complex new problems. Close Industry Engagement Involving it earlier to inform NATO's defence planning is the pinnacle of our efforts regarding industry, and it is going to take a major cultural shift to change decades of doing business with industry on a purely transactional basis. (ASG/DI interview to JANE s Defence Weekly, June 2016) Technological advancements take place naturally in industry, be it within traditional or non-traditional defence companies, so progressing new ideas is necessary to remain competitive. Often technological advancements have to be accompanied by conceptual and organisational adjustments. A more dynamic and open engagement with Industry, including non-defence related companies, will be essential to encourage technical and procedural innovation And that is where the NATO-Industry Forum can deliver significant results. Sponsored by the NATO Secretary General, and co-organized by the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation and the Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment, the NATO-Industry Forum has become the capstone annual event where NATO leadership, and National and EU politicians meet with industry, academia and think-tanks to debate strategies and define innovative solutions to multi-national capability needs. The 2016 edition of the Forum will build upon the recent decisions of the Heads of State and Government taken in Warsaw. Industry is not only a pillar of Alliance credibility, but also plays an essential role in Euro-Atlantic security and stability working to develop solutions that lower the threshold of conflict. NATO s ability to provide situational awareness of an adversary s intentions and the deployment of defence systems that diminish or neutralize initial aggression can help govern the political and military outcome from the very beginning of a conflict. Current and future acquisitions, exemplified by Ballistic Missile Defence, Allied C2 Systems, Alliance Ground Surveillance and Alliance Future Surveillance and Control, among others, were developed to improve situational awareness and security, and to lower the possibility of conflict. 15 16 The 2016 Forum will reiterate the need for synchronisation and non-duplication of the work with EU; it will attempt to stimulate the reinvestments in defence, and identify initiatives to support the optimal use of the recovering defence budgets, particularly regarding C2 and other priority capabilities. Bringing together top leaders from industry, NATO and European institutions, NATO- Industry Forum 2016 is offering the needed environment to make the dialogue with industry a reality. Hosted by Belgium, this edition of the NATO- Industry Forum will take place in Brussels, on 9 November The relationship with Industry is essential to inform and shape capability design, derisking, and delivering. A more dynamic and open engagement with industry, including non-defence related companies, is also essential to encourage technical and procedural innovation, and identify key technologies that could impact the way we conduct warfare in the future. SACT s Direction and Guidance on ACT- Industry Engagement March17 NATO CAPABILITIES - READ AHEAD OBJECTIVE Strengthening cooperation to retain NATO s warfighting edge NATO serves as an integrator, providing a comprehensive perspective and linking different processes into a single, logical thread to maintain the Alliance s warfighting edge. Industry is a key player in many Capability Development areas and strengthened cooperation would be beneficial for both sides. To this end, we are exploring ways to improve mutual (i.e. NATO-Industry) awareness of possible future needs and opportunities to improve the quality, effectiveness and availability of national capabilities. BACKGROUND Today, faced with an increasingly diverse, unpredictable, and demanding security environment, NATO remains determined to defend its territory and protect its populations, projecting stability beyond its borders, and continuing its political, military, and institutional adaptation. The complexity and uncertainty of the security environment is not expected to diminish in the near-term, thus NATO needs to make best use of all available resources to be ready to fulfil its mission. Industry is a pivotal player in this battle, providing NATO Nations with fit for purpose capabilities, thus a strengthened relationship among industry, Defence Investment international staff and ACT is essential for bolstering existing support to NATO from a capability development point of view. The changing security environment has required the Alliance to refocus its efforts to cope with the complexity of current challenges, while keeping an eye on the future. ACT has been conducting work in several interconnected areas, including those with a Capability Focus: - Security Foresight Analysis (SFA); - Framework for Future Alliance Operations (FFAO); - Technology Trends Survey (TTS); - Capability Focus; - Long Term Aspects (LTA); and - Solutions (e.g. AFSC). Over the last six months, ACT undertook a thorough analysis of all work strands related to Capability Development to streamline the entire mechanism and link various processes into one logical thread: from driver identification and analysis, to requirement identification and prioritization, to solution identification and generation. This single logical thread is based on a multitude of actors, processes, interests and comprehension of the challenges. In order to optimize NATO s ability to deal with complex and quickly shifting security challenges, the Alliance must harness all available efforts and drive coherence into capability development. NATO needs a renewed commitment from Industry, taking into consideration the potential opportunities and constraints this revitalized relationship will provide. CAPABILITY FOCUS Prepare: Improving the ability to carry out required training and exercises to ensure the ability to conduct full spectrum operations (Collective Defence, Crisis Management and Cooperative Security). Improving efficiency and effectiveness to address budgetary constraints. Command and Control: NATO is implementing a fully interoperable Air Command and Control System (ACCS), which will provide a modern, fully integrated set of tools to support all air operations. The system is composed of both static and deployable elements that will be used both within the NATO Command Structure and by individual Allies. With the further inclusion of command and control functionality for ballistic missile defence, a fully integrated system for air and missile defence at the tactical level will be fielded. 17 18 To ensure NATO is able to share information on Day 1 of operations, whether for humanitarian aid or peacekeeping operations, NATO is developing guidelines to ensure that any future coalition is network enabled. Federated Mission Networking is set of instructions to help build networks based on established and preapproved hardware, software instructions and procedures. The ability to share command and control and other relevant data from the beginning is a force multiplier and allows NATO or another coalition leader to effectively deploy assets from the beginning of an operation. Inform: As one of the most visible and tangible examples of what cooperation between Allies can achieve, the NATO Airborne Warning & Control System (AWACS) provides NATO-owned and operated airborne command and control, air and maritime surveillance, and battlespace management capability. To provide a foundation for NATO s Joint ISR ambition, the Alliance is currently developing a JISR Project aimed at providing the following three pillars: Training and education; Doctrine and procedures; and Networking environment. NATO communication and information systems (CIS) will guarantee efficient collaboration and sharing of ISR data, products and applications among Allies. Protect: NATO must continue to develop the capability to defend NATO European populations, territories and forces against ballistic missile attack as a core element of its collective defence. With respect to deployed forces, the Alliance has a requirement to further develop its capacity to defend against the threat of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons. The Alliance ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyber-attacks must be improved; including the ability to enhance and coordinate national cyber defence capabilities, bringing all NATO bodies under centralised cyber protection, and better integrating NATO cyber awareness, warning and response with member countries. The Alliance Maritime Strategy reiterates NATO s commitment to helping protect vital sea lines of communication, maritime approaches to NATO territory and maintaining freedom of navigation. This includes surveillance, information-sharing, maritime interdiction, effective mine counter-measures and other force protection activities and contributions to energy security, including the protection of critical infrastructure. Engage: The ability of the Alliance to deliver Joint Fires, particularly from the Air, requires continual development of enabling and self-protection capabilities. An example of this work is the Letter of Intent for Multinational Co-operation in the Area of Airborne Electronic Attack and Escort Jamming, signed by Poland and Turkey at the Warsaw Summit. Sustain (including Deploy): Air-to-Air Refuelling has previously been a focus of the Alliance, therefore, considering the renewed emphasis on high-end capabilities to counter the Russian threat, it should come as no surprise that it remains a key enabling capability. There is also a renewed emphasis on Deployable Medical Facilities and associated capabilities including ongoing capability development requirements driven by NATO s recent operational experience in Afghanistan. Air and sealift capabilities are a key enabler for operations and allow forces and equipment to be quickly deployed wherever they are needed. While there is significant national procurement, many Allies also have pooled resources, including with partner countries, to acquire new capacities through commercial arrangements or through purchase, giving them access to additional transport to swiftly move troops, equipment and supplies across the globe. 18 19 BIOGRAPHIES Paul Gilley Lockheed Martin, Managing Director for Mission Development and Integration Responsible for generating input and insight into critical mission needs and operational gaps, helping Lockheed Martin identify IRAD investments that will develop capabilities to address customer s most critical needs.

Emerging security challenges, socio-cultural change and technological innovation require a flexible and agile C2 capacity so that the combination of people, processes and technology are optimized for future challenges. To this end, we are exploring ways to improve mutual (i.e. NATO-Industry) awareness of possible future needs and opportunities to improve the quality, effectiveness and availability of C2 capabilities of NATO nations. NARRATIVE ACT sees Command and Control as a continuous, force-multiplying capability for networking a federation of NATO, Nations, Partners and other organizations to achieve comprehensive effects and cost-effective day zero readiness by combining a well-trained force with simplified structures, distributed processes and innovative technology. Command and Control implies a comprehensive Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) framework addressing the complete spectrum of collecting, decision-making, effecting and connecting activities. As such, Communications and Information Systems (CIS), Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JISR) as well as emerging Cyber capabilities are included. FUTURE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT To support long term Military Transformation, NATO has produced two fundamental documents to prepare for a complex and rapidly changing security environment. The Strategic Foresight Analysis (SFA) 1 establishes a common perspective of future challenges. Using SFA as the foundation to derive military implications, the Framework for Future Alliance Operations (FFAO) 2 outlines how Alliance forces might transform, proposing capabilities that may need to be developed. The following five themes capture the C2 implications identified in the SFA and FFAO: Complexity in Future Operations requires more agile and scalable C2 structures that leverage advances in technology such as federated information clouds and advanced computing power to achieve continuous strategic awareness and improved decision-making. Congested & Contested Battlespace requires improved real-time understanding, faster anomaly detection, continued interoperability improvements among NATO, Nations, Partners and other organizations, plus more dynamic planning and execution. Dynamic Communications Environment requires agile, secure and resilient networks, continuous access to information across the mission space, ability to shape the information environment and enhanced policies and procedures to connect with Partners and other organizations. Flexible System Design and Enhanced Autonomy provide an opportunity for domain agnostic, mission configurable and better integrated manned, unmanned and autonomous capabilities. Emerging Technologies require capitalization on advanced technologies like cloud computing 3, enhanced cryptology, artificial intelligence 4, cognitive computing 5 and advanced analytics 6. THE CONCEPTUAL APPROACH To meet the challenges posed by the future operating environment, NATO must establish broader, more persistent and robust C2 networks, integrating people, processes and technologies at all levels from NATO, Nations, Partners and other organizations. The future architecture of these dynamic network federations must be broader than just computer networks and include networks of experts, networked processes and fully networked capabilities. Our future C2 design must therefore be agile, secure and resilient to provide focussed awareness with an enhanced 360o perspective, supporting political-military decision making and delivering timely effects. As such, federation at all political and military levels will enable NATO to 1 Strategic Foresight Analysis, 2015, 2 Framework for Future Alliance Operations, 2015, 3 Network-based computing that provides information access on demand to customers from anywhere on a network. 4 Intelligence exhibited by machines. 5 Computer-based simulation of human thought using self-learning, pattern recognition and natural language processing. 6 Grouping of analytic techniques used to predict future outcomes. 2021 maintain its edge and optimize capacity and posture, while achieving the right levels of deterrence, readiness and responsiveness. To build and grow these federated networks by enhancing already established networks in a cost effective manner, integrating emerging networks and creating missing networks, we need to: Network with Nations and Partners through their national HQs to take advantage of regional expertise yet fuse it with a 360 o perspective. Network with the European Union, United Nations and other international organizations to create and sustain common strategic awareness. Network with non-traditional entities such as academia, industry and other experts to broaden the perspectives on rapidly changing technology and processes and their impact on people. Use non-traditional sources like publicly available information to understand the security environment from this perspective to enhance our strategic awareness. Fuse our intelligence, operations and planning analysis with publicly available information on a greater scale to enhance our understanding of the strategic environment. Transmit information over broad networks by providing multiple means to distribute information thereby improving our resilience. Employ advanced technologies to handle large amounts of information and aid our people in analysing, understanding and sharing it while keeping the human at the centre of decision-making. Use cloud federations at multiple security levels to horizontally and vertically network information to reduce ambiguity and leverage commercial advances. Integrate Cyber as a domain into our future C2 architecture from the onset. All these efforts aim to accelerate decision-making and achieve intended effects. DESIRED END-STATE C2 as a force-multiplier established NATO, Nations, Partners and other organizations are federated based on persistent relationships across all functions and employ greater use of publicly available information, which is further fused with intelligence to achieve enhanced strategic awareness, responsiveness and readiness. Applying these structures, processes and standards will ensure the total operational effect will be greater than the sum of its parts. Day zero readiness and responsiveness achieved Rather than reinventing C2 structures at the start of every named operation, C2 in the Alliance is continuous and comprehensive, establishing enduring trust and eliminating artificial differences through uninterrupted relationships. Global reach established A global, secure, and resilient federated cloud network will provide universal communication and freedom of movement in and through cyberspace by operationalizing the domain and capitalizing on industry innovative technologies in order to achieve Cyberspace Superiority. Collecting activities optimized Sensing capabilities are synchronized, continuous information sharing is established and open source big data is exploited by technology to aid our people in providing planning and operational options to decision makers. This makes information a strategic asset to create comprehensive and persistent situational awareness leading to Information Superiority. Decision-making accelerated Through the use of horizontally and vertically federated networks the processes are simplified, structures are optimized and decision cycles shortened. These along with widespread utilization of Mission Command principles and improved human sense making enable the Alliance to achieve sustained Decision Superiority. Effecting activities synchronized Coordinating and controlling effects is a key C2 function, to make sure all effects, both kinetic and non-kinetic, are optimized and synchronized to minimize collateral damage and achieve Execution Superiority. CONCLUSION Pursuing the vision and concepts presented here will ensure the C2 backbone of NATO is cost-effective, agile, resilient and ready to meet the challenges of the evolving security environment. These efforts will ensure that the Alliance remains relevant and is postured to achieve the desired deterrence based on political and military credibility. Without close cooperation with industry this cannot be achieved. 21 22 22 23 23 24 24 25 2526 C2 CAPSTONE CONCEPT SUMMARY PAPER PURPOSE: This paper provides a brief narrative of NATO s Command and Control (C2) Capstone Concept highlighting the overall vision for future C2 capabilities through 2030 and beyond. VISION: Command and Control is a continuous, force-multiplying capability for networking a federation of NATO, Nations, Partners and other organizations in order to achieve comprehensive effects and cost-effective day zero readiness by combining a well-trained force with simplified structures, distributed processes and innovative technology. BACKGROUND: C2 is often described as the backbone of NATO s political and military capacity, ensuring that collective effects are greater than the sum of individual parts. Emerging security challenges, socio-cultural change and technological innovation all demand that this C2 capacity is flexible and agile so that the combination of people, processes and technology is optimized to meet future challenges. When referring to Command and Control, this concept implies the more comprehensive Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) framework addressing the complete spectrum of collecting, decision-making, effecting and connecting activities. As such, Communications and Information Systems (CIS), Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JISR) as well as emerging Cyber capabilities are included in this concept. FUTURE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT: To support long term Military Transformation, NATO has produced two fundamental documents to prepare for the complex and rapidly changing future security environment. The Strategic Foresight Analysis (SFA) 7 establishes an institutional foresight to provide a common perspective of future challenges. Using SFA as the foundation to derive military implications, the Framework for Future Alliance Operations (FFAO) 8 outlines how Alliance forces might transform in the future and it proposes capabilities that may need to be developed. Through the analysis of these two documents, the following five themes capture the associated C2 implications: Complexity in Future Operations requires more agile and scalable C2 structures that leverage advances in technology such as federated information clouds and advance computing power to aid our people to achieve continuous strategic awareness and improved decision-making. Congested & Contested Battlespace requires improved real-time understanding, faster anomaly detection, continued interoperability improvements between NATO, Nations, Partners and other organizations plus more dynamic planning and execution.

The concept optimises our people and resources by utilising innovative processes, procedures and technologies to maintain our strategic advantage. All these efforts combined will ensure that the Alliance remains relevant and is postured to achieve the desired deterrence based on political and military credibility. 28 29 BIOGRAPHIES Marc Cathelineau THALES, Senior VP for EU-NATO-UN Responsible for EU & NATO relations for THALES.

This year s NATO Industry Forum is again sponsored by our Secretary General, Jens STOLTENBERG, and is attended by representatives from the European Union, the European Defence Agency, industries, academia, National Armament Directors, Chiefs of Defence, Military and Permanent Representatives to NATO, and the NATO Industrial Advisory Group all together representing 35 nations and 83 industries. There could be no greater proof, that the NATO Industry Forum has become the annual capstone event where NATO, and National political and military leadership meet with industry, academia and think-tanks from Europe and North America, to debate strategies aiming to define innovative solutions to capability needs that will enhance the Alliance s credibility, and ensure NATO to keep the military edge as a vital contribution to the Trans-Atlantic security. Building capabilities that fit NATO s purposes requires deep strategic foresight, and an understanding of the technological trends that will affect the future operating environment. The aim is to ensure that NATO remains a pre-eminent, powerful and efficient organisation now and in the future by leveraging all capabilities necessary to keep military superiority. But NATO cannot do this alone. Building the 21st century defence forces that will make the Alliance s defence and deterrence posture credible, can only be achieved through a close cooperation with industry. Therefore, regarding Industry, the final communique of the Warsaw Summit was very clear: A stronger defence industry across the Alliance, which includes small- and medium-sized enterprises, greater defence industrial and technological cooperation across the Atlantic and within Europe, and a robust industrial base in the whole of Europe and North America, remain essential for acquiring needed Alliance capabilities. Industry is therefore a crucial contributor to Alliance capability development and there is an increasing need to share innovation, identify new ideas and concepts, assess them and implement the most promising ones through appropriate national or multinational initiatives. Modern threats have no boundaries. It is also true for the accessibility of new technologies, and there s a fierce competition between a wide span of actors in the race to be a step ahead of any potential adversary. But there is no one organization in the world that has more powerful industry if we combine the competences of our 28 (soon 29) nations plus many Partners. It is an incredible strength! This sets the scene for this year s Industry Forum. We need to challenge our current processes to foster innovation and deliver the right capabilities on the right time to mitigate identified shortfalls. And we need to network our competences and look ahead to assess the decisions we make today. Thank you again for your presence, and I m looking forward to our candid discussions in the breakout and panel sessions. I wish us all a very fruitful forum, thank you for your attention. NATO Industry Forum has become the annual capstone event 31 32 STATE OF THE NIF Ambassadors, Excellencies, Admirals, Generals, Ladies and Gentlemen, Distinguished guests, Thank you Mr Huygelen, for your opening remarks on behalf of Minister Reynders, we are very honoured by your presence among us today, and thank you for the outstanding support of the Belgian authorities and their staffs to help organize the NATO Industry Forum in such exceptional conditions. The Egmont Palace is today s home of the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it also has a rich history and witnessed many historical and other important events. It is certainly an inspiring location for this year s NATO Industry Forum. At the Industry Forum this year we are honoured by the presence of so many distinguished guests. And I would like to add, in light of the US presidential elections results, and since my Command is the only NATO command located in the US, in Norfolk, VA, that I strongly believe in the strength of the transatlantic link. And this transatlantic link is, and I believe will remain, the foundation of our shared security, prosperity, and values. The Forum takes place 4 months after the historical Warsaw Summit where adaptation and resilience were at the top of the agenda. As we progress with NATO s adaptation, we scrutinize the future and make sure that today s political and military decisions, take into account the requirements of tomorrow. The capabilities we discuss today, have to meet the challenges posed by the future security environment. But first let me invite you for a short journey in a not too distant future. In 2031, the Northwest Trade passage through the Arctic has opened, but one nation seeks to deny access to this route. This nation deploys naval vessels and a complex web of air and missile defence systems in international waters and the adjacent littorals. To complicate matters, the aggressor nation employs civilian fishing vessels, believed to be proxies, to harass shipping vessels. Then tragedy strikes, a NATO flagged frigate, collides with a civilian fishing vessel. The adversary launches limited conventional attacks using autonomous swarming drones. Supported by a large part of the international community, NATO formally invokes Article V (Collective Defence) and mobilizes, but an A2AD (Anti Access and Area Denial) network stands in the way. Due to the heavy cyber-attacks against NATO s land-based operational headquarters, airborne and maritime command and control assets assume decentralized, operational control of forces in a network that can be re-configured in real time if necessary. NATO conducts multiple strikes against targets on the ground, in the air, in the sea, and cyber space as integrated cross-domain operations. Through a networked system of systems, the operation begins. Dynamically, forces share awareness, from the strategic to the tactical level, to create a common understanding and enable distribution of command and control. NATO operations are heavily supported by stand-off stratospheric drones and satellite communications. Although many current systems special forces, maritime forces, manned or unmanned air-assets - are on this battlefield, the difference is that they are networked into an integrated whole. By being able to decide and act faster than the adversary, manned and machined formations overwhelm it. Once the adversary s network of systems is disrupted and degraded, they are unable to achieve their strategic goals. This entire battle from crisis to resolution has been faster than NATO has ever seen before. In light of such a fictitious scenario, I am sure that you all possess unchallenged expertise in one or more of the above mentioned domains. However, to achieve this level of ambition, it is clear to me that we must change our way of thinking. 32 33 You have probably noticed that I have purposely not mentioned specific platforms (aircraft, ships, missiles, tanks or others) because we must no longer think in terms of platforms dedicated to one specific and sometimes narrow oriented purpose. No single platform can counter on its own integrated systems. What we have in mind and want to develop is a different approach aiming at thinking in terms of mobile ad-hoc networks (systems of systems), in which each element is able to sense, connect, process, make-sense and, eventually assist the commanders to decide and deliver the required effect. You all have parts of that puzzle for this vision to materialize. Today we can link very different platforms, in the civilian World, Apple Smartphones, Android tablets or Windows computers whether they are brand new or outdated not directly to each other, but indirectly through the Internet to exchange huge amounts of data. But we re still in the age of connected platforms in Defence let s move to the 21st century! We are still in the age of connected platforms in Defence let us move to the 21 st century! threats involved in potential crises. The question is how to build a network of connected objects, able to collect and share data and to allow distribution of operational control, a network that will enable our forces to keep the edge now and in the future against any adversary in a complex environment, as was fictively presented in the scenario? But first, we need to look at where we stand now, and what we need to do to prepare for this new and future operating-environment? Last July, our heads of State and government met in Warsaw, at a defining moment for the Alliance, a moment when our security and our values face significant challenges. Considering the recent evolution of the security environment in and around the Euro-Atlantic area, our political leaders took decisions to maintain our ability to tackle challenges and threats from a 360 degrees dimension, not only geographically speaking but also in terms of the wide range of actors and These measures have two main objectives: strengthening our defence and deterrence posture and projecting stability across NATO s borders. In this context, it is essential for the Alliance to keep its military edge through innovation with the aim to identify operational game changers and implement advanced and emerging new technologies applicable to the military domains. This is why the relationship with Industries is essential to inform and to shape capability design. A more dynamic and open engagement with industries, including non-defence industries, will give us the prospective of the art-of- the-possible. We must describe to the industries the problem we re trying to solve, for them to provide us with the potential solutions. I did not say solution! It is of course a two way street. We will inform industries of our analysis of the ever evolving future security environment in which we will conduct operations, and industries will inform us of the potential long term technological solutions they foresee to mitigate the shortfalls we have identified in terms of capability requirements. We will need to weigh the options between off the shelf capabilities and new capabilities development. We need to switch from a platform approach to an operational function approach. All platforms, air assets, ships, missiles, and ground forces 3334 are to be considered as connected objects. The added value will not be in the platforms themselves, but in their built-in capacity to be connected to fulfil an operational function. This requires a change of mind set. Systems engineering will be key in the development of any future capability. A perfect example is the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control (AFSC) capability, aimed to replace AWACs in the timeframe. I won t develop now but we will be able to come back on this topic during the discussions. Now that we have set the scene of what we need, and must do together, what have we already done to prepare for this? This year was an unprecedented year for industry engagement, thanks to the strong impulse received at last year s industry forum. Allow me to mention 4 key initiatives on which we will keep building. First, our common effort with the NATO industrial advisory group (NIAG) under the Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD). ACT and the NIAG are working on key areas, such as: Command and Control, Logistics and Sustainment, Capability shortfalls, Concept Development & Experimentation & Exercises. We expect concrete recommendations on global ubiquitous communications, federated resilience and cyber defence, artificial intelligence or federation of clouds. I want to take advantage of the participating industries present today to thank their leadership for their support to NATO through the NATO Industrial Advisory Group. Another example is our annual Industry Involvement Initiative in Exercises (I3X) which was just completed last week. It involved 21 members of industry having a close look at NATO s current challenges in Command and Control during the Trident Juncture Exercise (in Naples and Stavanger). We received very positive feedback from both industry and NATO participants and we will continue to work to improve I3X. Another line of effort this year has been to better develop our outreach with industries across the Euro-Atlantic area, including new, non-traditional, and small or medium sized industries (SME). That is why I extended the activity of ACT s Office for Collaboration with Academia and Industry (OCAI) in Norfolk, with a permanent point of contact in Europe for greater reachability. Yet, together with my co-organizer Camille Grand, NATO Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment, we decided to go even further and connect our Office for Collaboration with ACT in Norfolk, with a new footprint I want to set up in Brussels, together with the Defence Investment Division in the NATO Headquarters, and involving others such as the Science and Technology Organization, and the NATO agencies. We hope that structure will allow us to work better and communicate more coherently with industry. At this year s Chiefs of Transformation Conference (COTC) in Norfolk in December we will test the potential of new technologies (such as cognitive computing) that will impact and in fact are already impacting defence capabilities. Industry is an essential partner to ensure the credibility of our posture today and tomorrow! The COTC allows us to engage more with small and medium businesses, and even beyond the traditional defence industry. ACT has set up an Innovation Hub in Norfolk to enable free and unclassified exchanges on social networks and build strong communities of interest using online workshops. In today s and tomorrow s efforts, NATO s relationship with industry will continue to play a key role on the road to transformation. A more dynamic and open engagement with industry, including non-defence related companies, will remain essential to encourage technical and procedural innovation. We need to continue on this path, reinforce and consolidate our cooperation and making the tools necessary to offer quick practical solutions to new capability requirements. I would like to stress again that Industry is an essential partner to ensure the credibility of a posture today and tomorrow! Thank you for your attention. 34 35 PLENARY SESSION 1 - NATO CAPABILITIES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WARSAW SUMMIT Read ahead Delivering imaginative, innovative and integrated solutions based on a comprehensive description of future trends and measured effectiveness transforming Nations and NATO capabilities to maintain our warfighting edge. Current and future capability development must push limits, drive change, and be proactive with opportunities for National and NATO capabilities, to maintain the Alliance s warfighting edge. In order to implement a vision of imaginative and innovative\" capabilities, we must embrace change, identify new out of the box ideas, and adapt our way of working to exploit conceptual efforts in collaboration with the science and technology community, Industry, academia, and NATO Centres of Excellence. Allies have a single set of forces, therefore the coherence and complementarity with the European Union must be enhanced as declared at Warsaw, supporting the Alliance s ambitions as expressed in the Strategic Concept. NATO has devised a series of solutions to address the decline in defence budgets, which include the Defence Investment Pledge, the Framework Nations Concept and Multinational Approaches/Smart Defence. Additionally, NATO has developed roadmaps to assist Allies in meeting their capability planning objectives that could influence national investment, and research and development decisions. While initial results are encouraging, more remains to be done. Closer cooperation among the military, Industry, and the private sector will help find innovative and affordable solutions to meet the current and future security challenges. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, twenty-five years ago, NATO has proved resilient to changing international power structures, and this upcoming decade will test that ability again. Integrated Solutions Integrated means expanding beyond interoperability in the development of systems of systems. Solutions indicate that NATO capabilities aim to cover all DOTMLPFI 13 dimensions and be coordinated with Nations and other NATO bodies and organisations. Efforts to promote transformation should be based on identified future trends, including those from the Strategic Foresight Analysis and Framework for Future Alliance Operations, among others, and should be harmonised with short, medium, and long-term national plans. By connecting Technology Trends Surveys and Long Term Aspects of NATO capability development as strategic and visionary perspectives to the five steps of the NATO Defence Planning Process, the Alliance increases the chance of developing and delivering enduring capabilities that are future-proof. This can inspire National capability development, thus achieving synchronization with Alliance plans. Our future forces should be seen as a combat system, seamlessly integrating platforms, sensors and mission assets in cloud-like architectures. This vision for the future relies on an even closer engagement with Industry. Command and Control As NATO s capability backbone, Command and Control (C2) is the main driver for Alliance Transformation. Future C2 architectures must be derived from advances in Federated Mission Networking (FMN), which is a conceptual framework 13 Doctrine, Organisation, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities and Interoperability 35 36 consisting of people, processes and technology allowing the Alliance to plan, prepare, establish, use and terminate mission networks in support of operations. FMN will streamline C2 and decision-making in future operations through improved information sharing, providing the agility, flexibility and scalability needed to manage emerging requirements of any mission environment. Future C2 architectures must also be capable of managing big data at a high volume, speed and diversity in a cloud which is fed and accessed by relevant stakeholders, including NATO organisations and nations, and non-nato entities, across the Alliance and its missions. NATO s future C2 will provide authorities with the necessary global situational awareness to support faster and more efficient decision making at all levels and throughout the Organisation. All these considerations should be examined in the context of innovation as a persistent need, preserving intellectual rights, continuous cyber threats, and interconnectivity that is essential for all mission environments. This Plenary Session will explore the following key themes and questions: - Joint efforts to address long-term capability priorities. How feasible is it to initiate joint efforts, between NATO and Industry, to address the validity and the comprehensiveness of NATO s long-term capability priorities? Are industry priorities aligned with those of NATO, and vice-versa? - Engagement with Industry. Early engagement with Industry can help NATO shape the future more accurately while allowing Industry to understand strategic military objectives. This collaboration could allow NATO to deliver the right capabilities for the expected challenges. Currently NATO is updating its defence planning process, to introduce long-term aspects to capability development, to take into account, to inform and to attempt to harmonise long-term national developments. Where would industry see itself as playing a role, and how much is industry willing to share from its own long term plans? - Research & development cooperation and innovation. Interoperability and its natural pre-requisite, standardization, are essential for future Alliance success. How can research & development cooperation enable success? And what methods and solutions could be imagined, individually, multi-nationally or collectively, to boost the investments in innovation? - Innovation in capability development. Leadership in innovation has shifted from the defence and security sector to the commercial sector. What is missing in the current innovation process and what else do we need to do? How can we trigger the disruption needed for long-term transformation? What can Industry develop on their own and share, and what are the domains where NATO could help? 36 37 BIOGRAPHIES Fernando Abril-Martorell Indra, CEO Fernando holds a Business Degree from ICADE, and an LLB also from ICADE.

Roosevelt Today, the Alliance faces a range of security challenges and threats from 360 degrees around its periphery; including terrorism that has struck hard in many countries; a resurgent and unpredictable Russia employing hybrid techniques (e.g. Ukraine) that undermine the rules-based order in Europe; and instability in the Middle East and North Africa. Recent developments in EU Europe (including the launch of the Global Strategy for European Foreign and Security Policy, the vote on Brexit, Germany s adoption of a civil defence strategy, the impact of the migration crisis) and non-eu Europe (including Russia s snap military exercises and the failed military coup in Turkey) demonstrate that the world is as unpredictable as ever. Fuelled by rapid social, economic, scientific, technological and environmental change, the Alliance must adapt its strategic and tactical way of working to meet new and emerging threats. Industry plays a critical role in Alliance transformation and is an essential part of enduring Alliance credibility. This Panel will explore Industry leaders views of the future of capabilities within the evolving security environment. Warsaw Summit Outcomes Recognizing these challenges, Allied Heads of State and Government (HOSG) agreed at the Warsaw Summit to augment Alliance defensive capacity. HOSG decided to strengthen the Alliance s military presence in the east, and to develop a tailored forward presence in the south-eastern part of the Alliance. Allies declared Initial Operational Capability of NATO s Ballistic Missile Defence, noted the progress on Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JISR) and Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS), and decided that airborne warning and control systems (AWACS) will continue to be modernised and extended in service until 2035 when the Alliance needs to have a follow-on capability. Based on highlevel military requirements, Allies have decided collectively to start the process of defining options for future NATO surveillance and control capabilities. They also pledged to strengthen their national cyber defences and recognised cyberspace as an operational domain. Finally, NATO and the EU signed a joint declaration taking their partnership to an ambitious new level, including promotion of a strong defence industry and greater defence research and industrial cooperation within Europe and across the Atlantic. Convergence of Interests: NATO, Nations and Industry NATO Allies rely on a competitive defence and security Industry and Industry benefits from strategic guidance and coherent decisions made by nations through NATO. Furthermore, NATO and EU capability development must be harmonized to avoid unnecessary duplication, as explained in the joint NATO-EU declaration signed at Warsaw. NATO Allies, Industry, and the Alliance have shared interests. National interest is focused on protecting Industry as a source of human capital, security, self-sufficiency, and sometimes as an expression of sovereignty; Industry s interests focus on satisfying shareholders, advancing their global market position, and acting as a reliable social partner; NATO benefits from capabilities that are delivered on time and meet requirements, that are affordable, interoperable and able to secure its military superiority. Understanding the convergence of these critical interests is important for developing a strong defence industrial base in Europe and North-America, for a healthy transatlantic industrial cooperation, and for complementarity of 40 41 NATO and EU efforts. All these considerations should be examined in the context of innovation as a persistent need, preserving intellectual rights, continuous cyber threats, and interconnectivity that is essential for all mission environments. This Panel will explore the following key themes and questions: - Impact of defence investments. Witnessing the first increase in defence expenditure in a decade mostly due to the positive impact of the Defence Investment Pledge, what are industry s views on what (else) could be done in addition to NATO s Smart Defence and multinational cooperation initiatives, to increase the impact of these defence investments? How does industry assess the reverse in declining defence budgets over the past year, and what are their expectations for the future? - NATO Capability development, coordination and harmonisation. Consolidation of demand is praised by industry as critical, while nations are looking for a similar consolidation of delivery, as options to limit variation and thus increase commonality and interoperability. However, examples of such consolidations are not abundant. What role(s) could industry play, particularly in stimulating the consolidation of demand? - Multinational cooperation could NATO move from risk averse to risk management? Cooperation is often associated with delays, cost overruns, complexity and difficulty in other words, it is not the most attractive option. Cooperation is often perceived as the last resort and not the preferred solution. What can industry do to support NATO s efforts to make the transition from a risk averse organisation to implementing risk management practices, and to help increase the confidence in multinational cooperation? - Incentives vs. interests. Previously we explored options for dialogue between supply and demand, and for identifying incentives for industry and nations to cooperate. Instead it seems that we should identify critical converging interests for NATO, nations and Industry. Is this the right approach, and if so, how can we make this a recipe for success? - Research and Development Cooperation and Innovation. R&D to maintain and advance the military and technological advantage of Allied capabilities could benefit from more (structured) cooperation within the Alliance. While the European defence industrial base is important, the Trans-Atlantic link is essential. Various innovation initiatives could generate increased impact if they were synchronised. What are the options to complement Industry s own research and development with national efforts, and those of NATO? What ingredients are missing for better-structured Trans- Atlantic R&D? How can NATO efforts be better synchronised with national innovation initiatives, such as the US third offset strategy? 41 42 BIOGRAPHIES Marillyn Hewson Lockheed Martin, CEO Marillyn ranks as the fourth most powerful Woman in Business (2015, Fortune) and 20th most powerful in the world (2015, Forbes).

I thank the Secretary General for his invitation. This exchange between the industry, EU and NATO is timely at a moment when we must make ambitious moves towards more defence cooperation in Europe. The security challenges that Europe is currently facing are complex. The distinction between internal security and external defence becomes increasingly blurred. And these threats are becoming an everyday reality for EU citizens. They expect us to respond. No Member State is strong enough to meet those challenges on their own. Europe must become a security provider. Indeed, Europe s soft power is not enough on the long run without at least some integrated defence capacities as President Juncker said. This is not in contradiction with NATO. On the contrary, a stronger Europe in defence means ultimately a stronger NATO. We need a pragmatic EU-NATO partnership, in full respect of the decision-making autonomy of both organizations and respecting the principle of inclusiveness. This is also the reason why we are working on parallel tracks: Following the Global Strategy presented by Federica, we are focusing towards an implementation strategy to set the right level of ambition. Federica will develop this. At the same time, we will ensure mutual reinforcement, complementarity and coherence with NATO, notably through the implementation of the EU- NATO Joint Declaration signed in Warsaw in July. These are the first 2 pillars of our action. Federica will develop them. For my part, I would like to focus on the 3rd pillar, the industry pillar. As already announced, the Commission will come forward at the end of this month with the European Defence Action Plan. We have a clear objective: to provide support for the whole sequence of defence capabilities development. Modern military capabilities are often technologically complex and increasingly expensive. This puts strong pressure on national defence budgets which have suffered many years of reductions. So co-operation is the only way forward. For European defence to be strong, the European defence industry needs to innovate and remain competitive in the global markets. In that perspective, a competitive industrial base is a prerequisite to Europe's strategic autonomy, able to act in full complementarity with NATO. The Commission will act as an enabler and accelerator for European defence cooperation, proposing ambitious but necessary elements. The Commission is working in close co-ordination with the European External Action Service and the European Defence Agency. We have also closely involved Member States and the industry in the preparation with a series of technical meetings The Action plan will have 3 core pillars: Europe must become a security provider Funding defence research; Fostering investments in defence supply chains; and The joint financing of jointly agreed defence capacities through a potential European Defence Fund. These three pillars are underpinned by making the internal market for defence work more efficiently 4546 Our first proposal is to start with funding defence research at EU level. For the first time in EU history, the EU budget would be used to fund this. It makes sense to start with research. Cooperative research is the first phase of future cooperative programmes, industrial cooperation and common equipment. With this proposal, the Commission wants to incentivize cooperation right from the start. The lack of cooperation in defence costs Europe several billions of Euros per year. We collectively cannot afford it! And we are translating this into action already. We made a proposal for a Preparatory Action on defence research in the 2017 Draft Budget, with 25m in 2017 and an expected total amount of 90m over the next three years. I am glad that both the Council and the European Parliament agreed recently to it. This will pave the way for a future financing of a European Research Defence Programme in the next EU budget. My intention is to fund research in key defence technologies that are central to jointly agreed capabilities priorities. We can do this in full respect of the whole sequence of capabilities development. The EU funded research should complement rather than replacing national research defence priorities and spending. It should focus on disruptive technologies and on those technologies where Europe is dependent. It is indeed an issue of strategic autonomy for Europe. It should incentivise more European cooperation on new, future defence programmes and lead to collaborative development. In terms of governance, it should take into account the specificities of the defence market and research which we will test during the Preparatory Action. Industry and Member States will be directly involved in the set-up of priorities. We are aware that the IPR regime is an important element for the participation of the industry. I am convinced that we can find together the appropriate framework to be tested in the Preparatory Action. But, funding defence research is only the first step. Cooperating on Defence capabilities at the European level is not an option. It is a necessity. Our second proposal is to unlock EU Investments in the defence sector. At the moment, SMEs active in the field of defence have difficulties to access finance and cannot receive support at European level. Yet SMEs are central to the European defence industrial base, as well as industrial value chain and supply chains. Large corporations rely on a large number of SMEs to supply them with innovative technologies or services. In many Member States, SMEs are also the backbone of the defence sector. So we are working with Member States to provide financial tools for such SMEs to modernise their industrial capacities and scale up across borders. Our third proposal has already been announced by President Juncker. We are discussing with Member States on the possibility to work towards a European Defence Fund to support the joint financing of jointly-agreed defence capability programmes. Deciding together what capacity is needed is very important. Not only does it give everybody visibility, especially to the industry. It will also allow economies of scale, and avoid redundancies and ineffective allocation of funds while at the same time, ensuring interoperability. There are 154 types of weapons systems in Europe against 27 in the US. There are 37 types of light military vehicle against 9 for the US. Can we still afford this? So cooperating on defence capabilities at the European level is not an option. It is a necessity. The Fund should therefore bring forward an attractive and innovative financing model to jointly developed common defence capabilities. And of course this has to be done in full cooperation with NATO. But we are at the early stage of our reflection and discussion with Member States on the Fund. We will continue to work closely together. Ladies and Gentlemen, Europe is at a crossroad on many issues. Defence is one of them. Europe should be able to demonstrate to its citizens that it acts to protect them. It is time to be ambitious. It is time to take practical steps on fostering defence cooperation. Cooperation with NATO is central for success. In particular on the industry and capability fronts, we need to work together. We are not going to put into question the processes and initiatives carried within NATO. We are going to strengthen them with a stronger European dimension. I repeat it: A stronger Europe in Defence is ultimately a Stronger NATO. Let us work together. Thank You 46 47 KEYNOTE SPEECH - FEDERICA MOGHERINI Friends, Jens (Stoltenberg), Elzbieta (Bienkowska), First of all, let me say that I really appreciate this opportunity to be here together, to address all of you at this important forum at what is, I would say, a turning point for our common European defence, but also, especially today, for global politics. Let me say that, at least myself but I guess all of us, had maybe to review a little bit the text of our speeches this morning, checking which parts were still up-to-date and valid, which parts had to be underlined even more and I am glad to say no part of my speech had to be deleted which is I think a good sign. But let me say very clearly that I think that being here together today is more important than ever and I really appreciate, Jens, the possibility of doing so not only for the work we do together but also for the symbol. And sometimes symbols and images and messages are important in today's world. And being here today, working together, EU and NATO on our common industrial basis but also on our common defence across the Atlantic is something that today is more important than ever. And then it is very important for me to share this opportunity to address you together with Jens and Elzbieta because each of us can provide you with a different perspective on our common work to make the Europe of defence stronger with the assumption that making the Europe of defence stronger is also a way of making NATO stronger. Elzbieta has just spoken about the European Defence Action Plan, so I will not go back to that in details, that will focus on our industrial base, on innovation, on new technologies. But there is much more on which we are working. The Action Plan goes together with the implementation of our Global Strategy, and also with the follow-up to the EU-NATO Joint Declaration we signed in Warsaw last summer. And these three processes go hand in hand and reinforce and complement each other. And this is why we have been working so much in the last three, four months together with Jens, together with all our teams to make sure that things really are coordinated and proceed in parallel. Jens always says that a stronger European Union makes NATO stronger. And I obviously share this message very much. And of course, I would like also to share this, on the other side, saying that a stronger NATO makes Europe safer. Obviously, it goes without saying, at least on this side of the Atlantic for sure, that a stronger NATO makes also the US, Canada, all of us, safer. Making the European defence stronger is also a way of making NATO stronger We both follow our own path, the European Union and NATO are two different organisations, different in nature, different in mandate, but we run side by side and it is very important that we keep this parallel track very carefully in mind, as we are doing. Last June, Jens was the first person to receive our Global Strategy: I will remember that very well forever, because I gave him a copy just a few minutes after I had presented it to the Heads of States and Governments of the European Union in the European Council. Since then, we have met and consulted constantly, and our teams did, to make both the European Union and the Alliance stronger, with no duplications and in the closest possible cooperation. Now, the Global Strategy has spelled out a vision for a stronger European Union. And today, we are already turning this vision into action. I will present very ambitious and pragmatic Implementation Plan on Security and Defence to the European Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Defence one is here with us today, and we are moving fast, for once, indeed it can happen, not only on defence. The implementation of the Strategy is making fast progress also in other fields, connected with the work we are doing on security and defence, for 4748 instance on building resilience for societies and countries that are around us, or on connecting our internal and external policies, starting from those on counterterrorism or those on migration. Security today requires much more than the traditional military tools. This is very clear to NATO, this is very clear to the European Union. But we also know very well that development policies or other instruments that the European Union has in its toolbox - often require to be supported by security and defence tools, and that our civilian and military operations often go hand in hand. So that there is no contradiction between the soft power and the hard power we dispose of. And defence matters: also to a soft power or a traditionally perceived soft power as the European Union and I see a growing awareness about this among our citizens and among our governments. It will be up to our Member States now to define together what will be our level of ambition : this means we will define together the concrete challenges we believe it is essential we face together, as European Union, and the instruments that are needed to do so. There is already, as I see, a great degree of unity on our goals and objectives. And let me also be clear on what we already agreed on - and I had the opportunity to share this with Defence Ministers of NATO just a few weeks ago. We do not want to create another organisation for collective defence let me be very clear on this. This is simply because we do not need it. NATO remains the cornerstone of European defence, just like it has been for almost seventy years. But there are many challenges that do not, and probably will not in the near future, fall under NATO s mandate which is a very specific one, and need to be tackled as a matter of urgency. First, we need to protect our Union through our external action, because tackling terrorism or organised crime outside our borders is absolutely vital to our domestic security in Europe. Second, we need to respond to crises in our neighbourhood, because they affect directly the security of our citizens. And third, we need to strengthen the capacities of our neighbours and partners, because security in our age can only be a collective effort and the security of my neighbour or those We do not want to create another organisation for collective defence countries that are maybe not immediate neighbours in geographical terms but are connected with us through corridors, is also our own security. So through partnerships we can improve our security internally as well. I believe in this new phase of our global politics, Europe will be more and more an indispensable power. We see it today, I think, very clearly. There will be a growing request for a principled global security provider. For a super-power that believes in multilateralism and cooperation and partnership. For a reliable partner for peace, for growth and for democracy. There will be a rising call for a stronger European Union in the world. We are seeing this even in those hours. None of our Member States, as Elzbieta was very well saying, can answer this call alone. Nor the big Member States neither the small Member States. And let me share with you something I repeat very often: I believe EU Member States are of two kinds: the small ones and those which are not yet realised that they are small. We are living in a world that has a different size today. On the military side, in particular, we cannot rely totally on our American friends to fill the gaps. This would not be realistic, it would not be fair, and it would not be beneficial to our relationship with the United States. This is true today as it was yesterday; this is a part of my speech I have not changed. I have always been convinced that a healthy relationship with the Unites States needs a strong Europe of defence. And maybe we are living for the first time in a historic time when this is clear on both side of the Atlantic. And this opens up opportunities for us. Because it should be clear to everyone and it is starting to be clear to everyone that we can only succeed if we work together as a true Union. This is not something we should believe as an act of faith: our recent experience is what shows concretely that we are stronger together. I will give you an example: Operation Sophia - on which cooperation with NATO has started, is starting, in, I think, a very useful manner. No Member State of the European Union alone could have set up such a naval mission saving lives, arresting criminals, enforcing an arms embargo under UN mandate and training the Libyan coastguard and navy, all at the same time in a difficult security environment. And we have set up Operation Sophia in no more than two months, being endorsed by two unanimously adopted UN Security Council Resolutions. We need to make this kind of effective, practical, useful cooperation the norm and not the exception in the European Union and also, obviously, in cooperation with NATO. To reach this goal, our proposals in the Security and Defence Implementation Plan include also a better use of our rapid response forces, for instance with the flexible deployment of the Battlegroups. I 4849 mention sometime the fact that this could be an instrument to breach UN peacekeeping operations that, as we know, take a bit more time to be built up. But we are also discussing how to better integrate our civilian and military operations from the planning stage to the actual deployment and to improve coordination among our personnel here in Brussels and on the ground. Here again, let me be very clear, we are not thinking of establishing a big shape style headquarter but I can give you a news, the European Union has already five headquarters to run our seventeen missions and operations around the world. So, it is a matter of streamlining, making more effective use of the resources we already have. But this is not simply about a more coordinated use of our assets. We also need to invest more and better on our industry and on research. Elzbieta mentioned this but this is a world of continent-sized powers, with continent-sized budgets and research programmes. And we simply cannot afford a lack of coordination among our Member States I think the industry understands this much better than anyone else so we need your help. We have an immense potential in terms of economies of scale, joint research programmes, and a more predictable time-frame for investments. So we are exploring a large set of instruments, to make resources available. For instance, a Coordinated Annual Review on Defence what someone could refer to as the \"Defence Semester\", could facilitate joint programmes among Member States, and a more cooperative way of developing our capabilities. What strikes me always is not so much the spending gap across the Atlantic but the output gap across the Atlantic. We have to work on that, and we have the instruments to do so, especially working together with Elzbieta on the instruments that the Commission can use to incentivise our output. We could also envisage some kind of financial solidarity for common defence projects, as well as a broader range of collective funding options. We know that it might take a long time to develop a new technology, or to upgrade a military infrastructure. But that is only another reason for starting immediately without wasting more time. There are many concrete steps we can take right now under the current provisions of the Lisbon Treaty, without opening a huge, theoretical, philosophical, treaty debate. There are instruments that were foreseen in the Lisbon Treaty we never used. My personal impression is that the economic and financial crisis distracted us a bit from what we could have used or done in the field of security and defence after Lisbon but I think that now we have a window of opportunity politically to use the instruments we have. So concrete steps, pragmatic but concrete does not mean not ambitious, on the contrary. The steps I am taking about can represent a real turning point in the field of defence and security in Europe. They can be the real building blocks of a Europe of defence, finally, after six decades of setbacks and postponements. I do not need to go back to the history of the European Union's work on Defence and Security; you know that better than me. Maybe today we have the potential to use our potential again. Because our citizens need security. If you look at the polls across Europe, issue number one is security, issue number two is economy today, all across Europe. And we know well that security comes for our citizens only if we work together, within the European Union, as a true Union, investing in our Union also as a security Union, and together with NATO in full partnership and in strong friendship. It is what our citizens need, it is what our industry needs but this is more up to you to tell us, my sense is that it is the case and it is also, we believe, what NATO to be a force for good, together, strongly together, for our region and for the world. I thank you very much. 49 50 KEYNOTE SPEECH - JENS STOLTENBERG Deputy Prime Minister Reynders, ladies and gentlemen. First of all I would like to say that I m very pleased to be here tonight and to meet NATO-Industry Forum and especially to be here together with Federica and Elzbieta because I think that we share this stage reflects the close cooperation between NATO and the European Union but also between NATO, the European Union and the defence industry both in Europe and in North America. And that s exactly why forums like this are so important because this is a way to create a platform for politicians, for decision makers in NATO and the European Union to meet with the defence industry and to sit down together with you and to find out how we can work more closely together because we are totally dependent on you. The defence industry provides the equipment, the capabilities we need and you have actually provided us with the best equipment in the world and the most advanced capabilities in the world for decades. But we have to make sure that it continues to be like that in a more dangerous and more challenging security environment. And that s the reason why I welcome very much that we this year have the highest level of participation from industry ever at this NATO-Industry Forum reflecting the increased interest both from NATO and from the industry in how we can enhance our cooperation. And as you know NATO s main core task is to protect close to one billion citizens living in Europe and North America and I think that on a day like NATO s main core task is to protect close to one billion citizens living in Europe and North America this when the United States has elected a new President that provides me with the opportunity to congratulate Donald Trump as the new President of the United States and I look forward to work together with President-elect Trump in continuing to adapt NATO to a more challenging security environment. And a strong NATO is important for Europe but it s also important for North America and United States because we have to remember that two World Wars have taught us that peace and stability in Europe is important for Europe that s obvious, but it s also important for North America. And we have to remember that the only time we have invoked Article 5, our collective defence clause, was after an attack on the United States and thousands of soldiers from Europe and Canada have participated, contributed to the NATO presence there and more than a thousand have been killed in an operation that was triggered by an attack on the United States. So I think this is a day just to underline the importance of NATO, of strong institutions providing the platform for strong Trans-Atlantic cooperation. Then of course NATO can only be able to continue to provide deterrence, provide collective defence if we continue to have a strong defence industry and I know that this industry is full of people with a lot of skills, competence, ingenuity and you know a lot about what should I say technical measures which is far beyond what I will ever be able to understand. But that s not my task; my task is not to understand all the technicalities of the defence industry. My task is to find out how can I as Secretary General and NATO as a military political alliance provide the best possible framework for the industry to develop and to deliver the capabilities we need. And there are many ways to do that but our outline and focus on three areas where NATO plays a key role which is of great importance for the defence industry. And they are in different ways related to defence spending because NATO is decisive when it comes to how much allies spend on defence and on what allies spend and how they spend. And all of this is important for the defence industry. So let me start by defence spending, how much we spend. In 2014 we made a decision in ways to stop the cuts to gradually increase and to move towards spending 2 percent of GDP on defence. And I m actually very proud to be able to tell you that NATO is delivering, NATO allies are delivering because just a few months after we made that pledge in 2015 we were able for the first time in 5051 many years to have no cuts in defence spending across Europe and Canada combined. It was not a big increase in 2015 but it s a big difference between going down and going up and in 2015 we started to go up across Europe and Canada. Then in 2016 the latest estimates indicates 3 percent real increase and that s something. So we have even stronger increase in Then of course we have a long way to go and the picture is still very mixed, some allies are lagging really behind but some allies are really stepping up so in total we are moving in the right direction. I m not underestimating the challenges and I m not underestimating the efforts we have to put in place to be able to reach a 2 percent target but we didn t promise to reach the 2 percent target immediately. We promised to stop the cuts, to start to increase and to move towards a 2 percent within the decade, and at least we have started to do the first steps in that process. I can promise you that I as Secretary General will in all my meetings with leaders, Ministers, Prime Ministers and also Ministers of Finance continue to focus on the importance of increased defence spending in Europe and in Canada. So all nations reached a 2 percent target, some European allies already do that but many are what should I say still have a long way to go. We will also report on progress or lack of progress on defence spending on the defence investment pledge on our Ministerial meetings and defence spending will be an important issue at the NATO Summit next year where we will also welcome the new elected President of the United States here to Brussels. The reason why I am so focused on this is that it matters. If we are able to what should I say, reach the 2 percent target for all European allies and Canada that will provide 100 billion more U.S. dollars for defence and a 100 billion more U.S. dollars for defence is roughly the same amount for defence spending as France and U.K. combined spend on defence. So that would really add something to the total amount of defence spending. And I would also very much welcome the strong message from the European Union and from European leaders on the need to strengthen European defence also by increasing defence spending. I m not underestimating the challenges and the difficulties but I m only telling you that we have started to move and I will promise to continue to be as focused as I ve been since I became Secretary General in October 2014 on the issue of defence spending. If we are able to reach the two percent target for all European allies and Canada, that will provide 100 billion more for defence Then NATO also plays a key role not only when it comes to the total amount of money we spend on defence but we also play a key role when it comes to on what we spend. And NATO plays a key role in different ways when it comes to on what we spend. We do that, that s okay because I m looking for another page, we do that page 6 oh that s a good page, I do that because we have as part of the defence investment pledge decided not only to spend more but also to make sure that 20 percent of total defence spending goes to investments, equipment and research and development. Can allies deliver? But we have a long way to go and of course the more we can invest in research and development and on equipment the better for industry because then you have the market and then you have also more investments in innovation. But of course NATO is also important when it comes to on what we spend through our defence planning process and we are now in the midst of a new defence planning cycle. We are sitting down with all the 28 allies and identifying what do we need, what kind of capabilities, what kind of equipment does NATO need and this defence planning process is quite a bureaucratic process but it is extremely important. It s perhaps one of the most important things NATO does and that is to coordinate allies so we really work together and we fill the gaps when it comes to different kinds of defence capabilities and to make sure both that we have enough capabilities but also the right kind of capabilities and some kind of divisional responsibilities between the different NATO allies. When we have finished this defence planning cycle our task, my task, the task of the governments will be to make sure that we implement and that we follow up the guidelines and the defence planning conclusions. This is about for instance a guidance related to capabilities like joint intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, precision guided munition and strategic airlift so of course we all understand that it is important that we not only have defence planning but we also as I say, implement and follow the plans we have agreed. Then also NATO influence on what allies spend and what NATO spends on by our common funded projects; things like AWACS but also the successor the new Alliance Future Surveillance and Control System will be a big investment, big project and we have started to work on that project which shall than succeed the AWACS plane. I actually in a meeting saw that the plan is to have the new system in place by 2035 and for me as a politician that s far into the future; it s after at least the next election. But for people dealing with defence investments 2035 is just around the corner. So, it s the way things work in this industry. Then we also of course will work on projects like missile defence and alliance ground surveillance and other common funded and planned and implemented projects. The third area where NATO plays a key role in creating the framework for a strong defence industry in Europe and in United States is when it comes to how we spend. And both Federica and Elzbieta have already addressed that issue because there s a gap when it comes to defence spending between Europe and United States. But as Federica said there s also output gap 51 52 meaning that we don t get so much out of what we invest being it dollars, no we don t invest dollars in Europe but it is perhaps not yet, euros, pounds and kroner. We don t get as much out of that as we should because the defence market, the defence investments are too fragmented especially in Europe. So spending together is a way to spend smarter and we have to both spend more but we have to also make sure that we spend in a better way. And again NATO can make a big difference by encouraging greater multi-national collaboration and better coordination of allies requirements. And we all understand that need. In Europe we have 19 different types of infantry fighting vehicle, in the United States We need greater degree of coordination of requirements and investments from the European governments they have 1. In Europe we have 13 different types of air to air missiles, the United States has 3 and European nations have 29 different types of naval frigates, the United States has 4. So not only does the United States have more but they have, what should I say, divided into not so many different types while in Europe we have in total less and we are divided into many more types. And that makes it more expensive, it reduces the potential for a common economical scale, it makes training, research and development more expensive and it reduces the competitiveness of our industry. We need competition, we need different industries but we need some greater degree of coordination when it comes to requirements and investments from the European governments so we can get economical scale and reduce the unit costs of the different kinds of capabilities and equipment. And again I can tell you that I understand that this is not easy because I told some of you before that when I was Prime Minister back in 2000 in Norway we had a big discussion about buying 5 new Norwegian frigates for the Norwegian Navy and in Norway we are used to not building tanks we are used to not being, what should I say, advanced when it comes to constructing airplanes but we look upon ourselves as an advanced shipping nation and we have built ships and frigates for decades or actually centuries but then we decided to build the Norwegian frigates at a Spanish shipyard because they actually had the best and the cheapest offer and we decided to go for the best and the cheapest. One of the reasons why I lost the elections back in 2001 was because of that so I understand that this is not easy but sometimes we have to lose some elections and then come back. So there is something in between doing things which are absolutely impossible but also sometimes you need some political courage and to go for the best and the most effective things and then you also increase the competitiveness of your own industry if you are able to challenge and sometimes not only protect them. Then we can also improve the way we do our investments by working more closely with the European Union. And this is really something I welcome that we have been able to strengthen the cooperation with the European Union in so many different ways and not only was I the first to receive the Global Strategy from Federica, but one of the first, as we started almost the same day and we have been together not every day since but I think there s hardly anyone else I met so much as Federica and I also now working more and more with Elzbieta. And I think that reflects a true will both in the European Union and NATO to work together and to overcome some of the obstacles and to find pragmatic solutions for many different reasons but when I speak about defence industry this is also important for your industry. And we know that for instance several European nations are now working together on a multi-role air refuelling tankers that will serve both NATO and the European Union and we know that Denmark is in the lead when it comes to developing precision guided munition together with several other European countries. So there are some examples where we are able to work together and this is also part of what we do together with the European Union. In July I signed a declaration together with President Junker and President Tusk - it s a declaration about NATO-E.U. cooperation in many different fields. Federica mentioned some of them but one of the areas where we have decided to work together is capabilities and Federica and I are now working on the implementation follow up and we will present our conclusions in December and she told me when we went into this room that we are, what should I say, making good progress 5253 so I always trust Federica so this is going to be good. So, Federica and I are working on the implementation of the declaration and one of the issues we are addressing is exactly how we can also make some progress on capabilities and close cooperation in the development of capabilities between NATO and the European Union. And we are going to present our conclusions in December and we will then start to turn the declaration into concrete actions and the NATO Foreign Ministers will be asked to approve an implementation plan when they meet in December and we are preparing that meeting in December. So, let me end by stating once again that the defence industry is full of capable people and by harnessing their talents and ideas and by putting the most advanced technologies in the hands of our brave men and women in uniform and by working more effectively together we are all more secure and therefore I appreciate so much this cooperation with the defence industry. Thank you 53 54 CLOSING REMARKS DIDIER REYNDERS The Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belgium welcomed all participants to the NATO-Industry Forum in Egmont Palace new facilities and the old palace, and expressed hope for similar opportunity in the future. He mentioned that 9 November 2016 was an important day for the Trans- Atlantic cooperation following the election of the new President of the United States of America. The Minister was pleased to extend his welcome to the President in the new NATO HQ on the occasion of the 2017 NATO Summit. He also highlighted the importance for all Allies to deliver more on security and defence, building upon the process started within the EU. That would include bilateral arrangements such as the Belgium-Netherlands cooperation, but also strengthening the European pillar of defence and the cooperation inside and with partners outside the European Union, as necessary and appropriate. Such a European Pillar will inherently be built upon a solid defence industry, which has to be maintained and strengthened in Europe. The European champions mentioned earlier during the NIF debates, can be exemplified by Airbus considered a true industrial champion in the civil aviation domain. Nations show their commitment through investments, and he mentioned that Belgium will invest 9 Billion Euro to modernize its Armed Forces. CLOSING REMARKS CAMILLE GRAND The Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment expressed on behalf of NATO co-organisers, the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, General Denis Mercier, and himself, deep gratitude to Belgian authorities for hosting the NATO-Industry Forum in such outstanding conditions. He thanked participants, and in particular, the panellists, for their most valuable contribution to the debate, from which he highlighted several directions of interest identified throughout the day: NATO to become a faster and more agile organisation, particularly in procurement; to deepen the engagement with industry; to work together with industry in the 21st century standardization; to foster innovation, and develop a common innovation plan to support this initiative. He finally called for more cooperation and dialogue within Europe and Trans- Atlantically. 54 55 55 56 Contacts: 56 View more Similar documents Prospects for the NATO Warsaw Summit Testimony before the U.S. Helsinki Commission By Hans Binnendijk June 23, 2016 Prospects for the NATO Warsaw Summit Testimony before the U.S. Helsinki Commission By Hans Binnendijk June 23, 2016 NATO is anything but obsolete.

Gilroy May 27, 2011 Most of us have become aware of the potential for climate change to lead to such drastic conditions as sea level rise, drought, crop failures and heat waves, but it also has the potential to bring with it extremism, terrorism and authoritarianism. That is the conclusion of a NATO workshop on climate change, human health and national security in which Harindra Joseph S. Fernando, Wayne and Diana Murdy Professor of Civil Engineering and Geological Sciences at the University of Notre Dame, served as a key organizer and presenter. The NATO Advanced Research Workshop (ARW) on Climate Change, Human Health and National Security was held recently in Dubrovnik, Croatia, under the sponsorship of the NATO Science for Peace and Security Program. Thirty-two invitees from 17 countries participated in the workshop. \"The workshop highlight was the multidisciplinary, where leading modelers, natural, political and social scientists, engineers, politicians, military experts, urban planners, industry analysts, epidemiologists and healthcare professionals parsed the topic on common platform,\" Fernando said. The conference report noted that drought and changing rainfall patterns may exacerbate food and water shortages, especially in the Third World, which is already inflicted with poverty and hunger. This, in turn, may create humanitarian crises such as pandemics, trans-border climate refugees and conflicts, threatening the security of individuals and nations. Citizen demand for essential goods and services may outstrip the ability of governments to meet them, leading to extremism, radical ideologies, terrorism and authoritarianism. Fernando notes that conference attendees believe that climate impacts will be most profound in urban areas, where environmental degradation is most prevalent, threatening the very sustainability of cities. \"Large (mega) cities are bound to feel the brunt of climate change, and so will be the centers of conflict origination,\" Fernando said. \"The minimum nighttime temperatures in cities are increasing faster than the global averages, which, together with the 'urban heat island effect' makes cities more energy intensive and pollution prone. Poor and at-risk communities are the most vulnerable, and marginalization feeds into existing conflicts and grievances.\" The conference report concludes that the key in facing the socioeconomic and political challenges of climate change is to use key natural resources, such as air and water, as powerful resources for fostering peace and climate change discussion among stakeholders, communities, nations and scientists. Fernando is an expert in fluid mechanics, specifically in atmospheric and oceanic flows as well as industrial flows involving density variations. At Notre Dame, he is focusing on defense, environment, energy and sustainability issues. Contact: Harindra Joseph S.

Includes footage of simulated close-quarters firefights and protection procedures.TEXT ON SCREEN NATO CLOSE PROTECTION AGENTS SOUNDBITE IN ENGLISH ANON \"There are people working at NATO who are doing their best to keep the world safe. Our job is to keep them safe. Often people get the impression that a close protection agent should be a macho type, which is absolutely not the type of person who works in the NATO Close Protection Unit. A close protection agent is trained for a lot of things, and they just need to be ready to be able to do what is expected in normal situations, in tense situations and in situations of a higher risk.\" UPSOT \"Contact front, contact front!\" --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH)-- ANON \"We are constantly developing medical skills, studying and training on weapons, improving our driving skills and communication skills. There are many highly skilled female close protection agents, but unfortunately we don't have any working in the NATO Close Protection Unit right now. We are actively recruiting for female agents. Working as a close protection agent for NATO is a great privilege. It's a high-profile environment with high-profile people.

The VJTF will play a critical role in Trident Juncture 2018, a large NATO exercise involving some 40,000 troops from more than 30 nations. This video features the German Army's 9th Armoured Brigade, which will lead the VJTF in 2019, and Norway's Telemark Battalion, which will also participate in the VJTF starting next year. The United Kingdom currently leads the VJTF, which is staffed by Allies on a rotational basis. Shots: German armour crossing a river via ferry; Norwegian troops engaging in close-quarters urban combat. Soundbites from Brigadier General Ulrich Spannuth, who will lead the VJTF's land component in 2019, and Norwegian Capt.

From soldiers to scientists, cyber experts to civilian emergency responders, NATO members are committed to supporting and protecting each other. Private First Class Elva Karzova of the Latvian Army talks you through the stages of applying camouflage face paint in a 1-minute video tutorial. Effective use of military camouflage paint means breaking up the visual patterns of the human face - applying dark paint where light hits the face (cheekbones, chin), and light paint where the face is shadowed (eyes). Elva shows you how, with a few fingers of paint, she can blend into her surroundings. Interview in English. TRANSCRIPT:Karzova applying paint --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH)-- Private First Class Elva Karzova, Latvian Land Forces 'I'm Private First Class Elva Karzova. And this is a camouflage paint tutorial. First colour we put is black. On our forehead, cheek, nose, jawline, because these are the lightest places of the face. Now we're going on to the green one. With the green one we actually break the contours of the face. Here. The jawline is a really big contour. And maybe a little bit of forehead. We need to break contours because there are no sharp edges in the nature. The main mistake is forgetting your ears and your neck. Next up we go to the brown, to blend everything out. So when you're done, you shouldn't have any white spots on your face. When I've done all this, I can use the environment and my surroundings to my advantage.\"Camo Paint Tutorial, Master Version2018-10-05--:--:--#box-pro-ellipsis-15424985501665{-webkit-line-clamp:5;-webkit-box-orient: vertical;}The 9th Armoured Brigade, part of Germany's 1st Armoured Division, under the operational control of 1 German-Netherlands Corps, use M3 amphibious rigs to transport armoured vehicles across the Weser River near Eystrup, Germany. Germany will lead NATO's Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) in 2019, and will be responsible for its quick deployment anywhere that NATO may need it. This exercise was a warm-up for that role. The VJTF is NATO's quick reaction force, made up of over 5,000 troops ready to move within two to five days. The ability to move forces and equipment across borders is a big priority for NATO. The Alliance works on this with its members, as well as with the European Union. Footage includes various shots of the equipment and process used to cross the river.How NATO Gets Tanks Across Rivers2018-10-05--:--:--#box-pro-ellipsis-154249855016783{-webkit-line-clamp:5;-webkit-box-orient: vertical;}Find out how it feels to be put through high G-force centrifuge training with Poland's first female fighter pilot, Lt Katarzyna Tomiak-Siemieniewicz.For fighter pilots to maintain their composure during aerial combat, they must undergo training at high gravitational forces (G-forces). Aggressive maneuvers at high speed drain the blood from a pilot's head with centrifugal force - so while they're tracking their target and flying the aircraft, they're clinging to consciousness. Poland's first female fighter pilot, Lt Katarzyna Tomiak-Siemieniewicz, undergoes high G-force centrifuge training at a specialist facility in Poland. Footage includes Lt Tomiak-Siemieniewicz inside a high G-force centrifuge, and an interview about changes she feels at various levels of G-force.What happens to pilots at high gravitational forces?, Master Version2018-09-0700:01:04#box-pro-ellipsis-154249855016751{-webkit-line-clamp:5;-webkit-box-orient: vertical;}NATO's Close Protection Unit for the Secretary General is made up of highly skilled and highly trained individuals.

During one operation in Kabul, Mali helped secure a multi-story building that had been taken over by hostile forces. He conducted searches for explosives while under direct fire. He sustained serious injuries from the attack but had saved many lives. Mali went on to receive the PDSA (People's Dispensary for Sick Animals) Dickin Medal in recognition for his bravery - the animal equivalent to the Victoria Cross, which is the highest award of the British honours system. The footage includes archive shots of the attack in Kabul as well as Mali at his new home in England.Mali, The Hero Dog2018-09-07--:--:--#box-pro-ellipsis-154249855016788{-webkit-line-clamp:5;-webkit-box-orient: vertical;}The information war which has broken out over Russia's actions in Ukraine has largely been seen as two sides projecting differing opinions. But the way information is controlled, twisted and spread can have serious effects.

Engaging with civil aviation is key in an increasingly busy airspace. Therefore, NATO works together with organisations such as ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) and EUROCONTROL for accommodation of military operations, planning of military exercises, day-to-day information-sharing, executing air policing activities, as well as working on projects to ensure safety of air traffic in different regions. One of the more notable civil-military initiatives by ICAO - the Baltic Sea Project Team - recently brought together NATO and Russia alongside other countries to cooperate in ensuring safety of air operations over the Baltic Sea. Footage includes interviews with representatives from NATO, ICAO, EUROCONTROL, as well as shots of air policing, a NATO Aviation Committee meeting, and various civil and military aircraft.Keeping our Airspace Safe2018-08-02--:--:--#box-pro-ellipsis-154249855016850{-webkit-line-clamp:5;-webkit-box-orient: vertical;}In the event of a crisis, NATO must quickly assemble and deploy forces to defend its Allies by whatever means necessary - land, sea or air. But pulling off this logistical feat requires practice. NATO Allies conduct a wide range of exercises to test their ability to rapidly deploy troops directly into combat. This year, US Marines and Romanian naval infantry deployed from the Baltic Sea as part of Exercise Baltic Operations 18; US and Polish airborne troops hit the battlefield as part of Exercise Swift Response 18; and US and German Army engineers constructed bridges to cross rivers during Exercise Saber Strike 18. The exercises took place in Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Romania. Footage includes amphibious assaults, airborne operations, ribbon bridge construction, and an interview with US Navy Captain Brian Finman.How Does NATO Rapidly Deploy Troops?2018-08-02--:--:-- See MoreComments Download from Google PlayDownload from App StorePolicyBlogAboutUnited States ", "keywords": ["nato", "protection", "paint", "readiness", "shots", "exercise", "camouflage", "agents", "footage", "troops"]}, {"url": null, "text": " CareerShapers Search Primary Menu Skip to content About Quiz What?

The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global defence spending. NATO Headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, while the headquarters of Allied Command Operations is near Mons, Belgium. Its other official name is the French equivalent, l'Organisation du Traite de l'Atlantique Nord (OTAN) (English and French being the two official languages of the organisation). Current Heads Secretary General - Jens Stoltenberg Chairman of the NATO Military Committee - General Petr Pavel, Czech Land Forces Supreme Allied Commander Europe - General Curtis Scaparrotti, United States Army Supreme Allied Commander Transformation - General Denis Mercier, French Air Force Background The Treaty of Brussels, signed on 17 March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, is considered the precursor to the NATO agreement. This treaty established a military alliance, later to become the Western European Union. However, American participation was thought necessary in order to counter the military power of the Soviet Union, and therefore talks for a new military alliance began almost immediately. These talks resulted in the North Atlantic Treaty, which was signed in Washington, DC on 4 April 1949. It included the five Treaty of Brussels states, United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Three years later, on 18 February 1952, Greece and Turkey also joined. Because of geography, Australia and New Zealand missed out on membership. In place of this, the ANZUS agreement was made by the United States with these nations. The incorporation of West Germany into the organisation on 9 May 1955 was described as \"a decisive turning point in the history of our continent\" by Halvard Lange, Foreign Minister of Norway at the time. Indeed, one of its immediate results was the creation of the Warsaw Pact, signed on 14 May 1955 by the Soviet Union and its satellite states as a formal response to this event, firmly establishing the two opposing sides of the Cold War. Structure of Nato. The Structure of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is complex and multi-faceted. The decision-making body is the North Atlantic Council (NAC), and the member state representatives also sit on the Defence Planning Committee (DPC) and the Nuclear Planning Group (NPG).Below that the Secretary General of NATO directs the civilian International Staff, that is divided into administrative divisions, offices and other organizations. Also responsible to the NAC, DPC, and NPG are a host of committees that supervise the various NATO logistics and standardisation agencies. The NATO Military Committee advises and assists the NAC on military matters. The Defence Planning Committee which directs its output to the Division of Defence Policy and Planning, a nominally civilian department that works closely with the Military Committee's International Military Staff. The Defence Planning Committee was a former senior decision-making body on matters relating to the integrated military structure of the Alliance. It was dissolved following a major committee review in June 2010 and its responsibilities absorbed by the North Atlantic Council. All agencies and organizations integrated into either the civilian administrative or military executive roles. For the most part they perform roles and functions that directly or indirectly support the security role of the alliance as a whole. Military Structure. NATO's military operations are directed by the Chairman of the NATO Military Committee, and split into two Strategic Commands long both commanded by U.S. officers, assisted by a staff drawn from across NATO. The Strategic Commanders are responsible to the NATO Military Committee for the overall direction and conduct of all Alliance military matters within their areas of command. The Strategic Commanders are the former 'Major NATO Commanders', who sat atop a command hierarchy consisting of Major Subordinate Commanders (MSCs), Principal Subordinate Commanders (PSCs) and Sub-PSCs. The Military Committee had an executive body, the Standing Group, made up of representatives from France, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The Standing Group was abolished during the major reform of 1967 that resulted from France's departure from the NATO Military Command Structure. Participating Members NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is an international alliance that consists of 29 member states from North America and Europe. Of the 29 member countries, two are located in North America (Canada and the United States) and 27 are European countries while Turkey is in Eurasia. Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Rep, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland , Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States Other Partners NATO maintains foreign relations with many non-member countries across the globe. NATO runs a number of programs which provide a framework for the partnerships between itself and these non-member nations, typically based on that country's location. Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Finland, Georgia, Ireland, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Malta, The Republic of Moldova, Russia, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland, Tajikistan, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan NATO's Mediterranean Dialogue Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia Istanbul Cooperation Initiative Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates Partners across the globe In addition to its formal partnerships, NATO cooperates with a range of countries which are not part of these structures. Often referred to as \"Partners across the globe\", these countries develop cooperation with NATO in areas of mutual interest, including emerging security challenges, and some contribute actively to NATO operations either militarily or in some other way. Australia, Colombia, Japan, South Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq. Latest Developments Colombia has formally joined North Atlantic Treaty Organization as global partner. It makes it first Latin American to join NATO. The announcement came after Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) approved Colombia as a new member. NATO alliance had reached partnership agreement with Colombia back in May 2017, just after the Latin American signed peace agreement with communist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), ending the longest-running civil conflict in Latin America. The peace deal had earned Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos 2016 Nobel Peace Prize. As a global partner with NATO, Colombia will not necessarily have to take part in active military actions of NATO but will be fully accredited to 29-nation military alliance. It will cooperate on global security areas like cyber and maritime security, terrorism and links to organized crime.

Follow NOVANEWS 2.2 Million Iraqis, 7.6 Million Syrian Displaced by Saudi Zio-Wahhabi ISIS A Norwegian humanitarian group says a record 38 million people have been internally displaced in their countries worldwide, with 2.2 million Iraqis alone forced to flee from their homes in 2014 after Zio-Wahhabi ISIS overran their areas. The study by the Norwegian Refugee Council's Internal Displacement Monitoring Center was released Wednesday, AP reports. It says 11 million were newly displaced last year - mostly because of conflicts in Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo, accounting for 60 percent of the new displacement. The group says at least 1.1 million Syrians also fled their homes last year. Syria has the highest number of internally displaced, with 7.6 million dislodged because of Saudi Zio-Wahhabi war, now in its fifth year. That's at least 35 percent of the population.

Formed in 1992, HQ ARRC is a highly capable mutlinational headquarters designed for rapid worldwide deployment. Headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (HQ ARRC) provides NATO with a well-manned, rapidly deployable, flexible HQ that can act as a Joint, Land or Corps HQ for operations and crisis response. Its European, multi-national ethos, combination of cultures and innovation, strong professional reputation in NATO and proven track record in interoperability are unique among its High Readiness Force (Land) (HRF(L)) peers. 2017 marked the 25th anniversary as HQ ARRC and 200th Anniversary of its antecedent, 1 Corps. Throughout its history the Corps has played a key role in international events. It began its journey fighting under Wellington at Waterloo. In the First World War it fought in France and Belgium, and in the Second World War it was responsible for two of the D-Day beachheads and a number of airborne assaults, as part of the Allied re-entry into Europe. Throughout the Cold War 1 (BR) Corps was the UK's contribution to NATO's defence against the Soviet Union. With the end of the Cold War, HQ ARRC emerged as the first NATO Rapid Reaction Land Force Headquarters. Such was the success of the structure developed by ARRC, in 2002 it was used as the model for the development of other HRF(L) Headquarters. From 1994 until 2010, the ARRC was based in Rheindahlen, Germany. In 2010 the ARRC moved to its current location at, Imjin Barracks, Gloucester. In line with its operational ethos, ARRC commanded the Land element of NATO's first ever deployment as part of the Implementation Force (IFOR) operation in Bosnia in 1995. It deployed again as the headquarters commanding Land Forces during the Kosovo War in 1999. Other operations have included the formation of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan in 2006 and as ISAF Joint Command in 2011. Today, the ARRC is the UK's largest deployable Land HQ. It remains the UK's contribution to NATO's HRF(L) structure and is unique amongst all other HRF(L)s by falling under the direct Operational Command of Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR) during peacetime. Although HQ ARRC's 'framework nation' is the United Kingdom, comprising approximately sixty percent of the overall staff, the ARRC is fully multinational in nature and organisation, with twenty-one NATO and Partner Nations overall contributing personnel. A number of other nations will become part of the ARRC before the end of 2017. 07/09/2018 Best of all worlds - NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Corps holds international families day at its barracks in #Gloucestershire | Images Sergeant Jon Bevan RLC #WeAreNATO... 01/09/2018 Happy #GloucesterDay - as the city celebrates the lifting of the 1643 Siege of Gloucester.

Additional funds are to be used entirely for the purchase of modern equipment and technology in the context of the modernization of the Polish Armed Forces and the strengthening of the defence infrastructure, in particular, in the eastern part of the country. This decision, if implemented, will result in Poland joining the small group of NATO countries that fulfil the recommendations of the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the relevant expenditure on defence.[1] Defence spending within NATO has been falling for many years. In the past five years, NATO countries have lowered average spending by 13 percent, caused by, among other factors, the effects of the economic crisis. In contrast, Poland has continued to increase in real terms its defence expenditure, thanks to the statutory rule that guarantees the yearly transfer of 1.95 percent of GDP for this purpose. In addition, the disparity between the defence budgets of the United States and European countries has been widening. While the U.S. allocated 3.8 percent GDP in 2013, in Europe there are countries that spent less than 1 percent GDP on defence. This has had a direct impact not only on the security of the member states, but also on the military abilities of the Alliance. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that this trend will be reversed in the coming years. What's more, the biggest European NATO members such as Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy are instead planning further reductions in subsequent years.

President D. Grybauskaite believes that Lithuania should reach 2.0 percent over 5 years.Iceland0.5There are no plans to increase the budget.Luxemburg0.4There are no plans to increase the budget. In the next few years the imbalance in military policies between Europe and Asia will be exacerbated. While the spending on defence in the Old Continent has been falling, Russia, China and the Middle East countries have all been increasing their expenditures on modernizing their armed forces. Although it is difficult to verify the actual size of the defence budgets of Russia, and especially China (they are not transparent), it can be assumed that for a long time, they have grown at a rate of approximately 10 percent annually. For Poland it is worrying that this military stagnation is occurring primarily in Central Europe. Weak points on the military map are particularly some of the Baltic states (Latvia and Lithuania), the majority of the Visegrad Group countries (Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary), and Bulgaria, where spending on defence and the role of the armed forces has been steadily falling. This weakens the eastern border of NATO. The continuation of this trend threatens transatlantic cooperation. In the United States, there is a growing belief (expressed by successive Secretaries of Defence and by President Barack Obama at the Warsaw Castle Square on June 4, 2014) that Europe should take greater responsibility for its own safety. Following this, the presence of U.S. armed forces in the Old Continent has systematically been reduced. The decrease in defence expenditures in European countries in the long run will be even more discouraging for the U.S. to guarantee the financing of European security, and as a result, the transatlantic ties will continues to weaken. The decrease in the number of countries willing to spend the appropriate amount on defence, and willing to participate in operations and exercises of NATO and the EU, will lead to a weakening of the cooperation within these structures. Within the EU there has been an ongoing retreat from the Common Security and Defence Policy for regional and bilateral cooperation. Similar trends have been observed within NATO. Therefore, only the countries with a strong army, defence industry and incurring large expenditures on defence will become a desirable partner and will gain political importance. The decrease in defence spending is a result of (in addition to economic factors) a decreasing sense of traditional threats, i.e. the possible outbreak of war, which would take the form of a hostile aggression or an armed attack on the territory of a member state. In recent years, the role of the army as a deterrent has decreased in some European states, leading to the marginalization of the armed forces. This trend has not stopped, despite the experience of the Russian-Georgian war of 2008. The following question is still unanswered: will the current actions of Russia against Ukraine contribute to the reversal of this trend? It is also worth noting that the reconstruction of the strength and importance of the armed forces and of the so-called military tradition is a difficult and very costly process. Falling defence spending in European countries, and thus reducing the expenditure on modernization of the armed forces, also poses serious problems for defence companies. In search of markets they are ready to sell modern weapons to countries which in the future may pose a threat to NATO and the EU, or use it in ways that threaten the stability of the Old Continent. The selling of French Mistral-class amphibious assault ships to Russia is one example of this type of threat. In the context of the above, a stable and relatively high (compared to other European countries) defence budget gives Poland the opportunity to improve its position and importance in the field of European security policy. However, this is not a sufficient factor. Only thanks to a rise in the potential of the defence industry and a willingness to participate in joint ventures (projects on the basis of pooling and sharing / smart defence and military missions) will Poland gain the position of a desirable partner for the leading EU countries. Otherwise, the budget will reduce Poland's role in reaching an attractive market for foreign defence companies. It is necessary to take into account the willingness of foreign partners, who will be selected in modernization bids for the Polish armed forces, to cooperate with Polish entities. It is also important to raise the ratio of research and development. Conclusions The decision to increase defence spending to 2 per cent will place Poland in a small group of NATO countries that meet the guidelines in this regard. This will enhance the position of the Republic of Poland and its role in European security policy. This will also open up the possibility of cooperation with major partners in the field of defence. However, it is important that this contributes to the development of the Polish industrial base. The negative trend of reducing spending on armaments in NATO is becoming more and more pronounced. Over the next five years one may expect a further decline in defence expenditures among the largest countries of the Alliance. This is worrying, especially in view of the steady growth in this area in Russia and China. The question remains as to whether this trend will be stopped as a result of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. This phenomenon may in the future undermine NATO's credibility and fulfilment of its main function, which is to defend member states, as well as the other tasks of the Alliance, such as crisis management and cooperative security. The decrease in defence spending in European countries negatively affects the state of transatlantic relations. Poland's particular concern is the military stagnation in Central Europe. This weakens regional cooperation (e.g. of the Visegrad Group) and the position of the region in the EU and NATO.

The lecture will be delivered by Prof. Horace Campbell, a professor of International Peace at Syracuse University in the United States but currently at the Institute of African Studies at the University of Ghana. Campbell is the author of, among others, the empirically rich 2013 book Global NATO and the Catastrophic Failure in Libya. It is a smashing critique of NATO dense with the minutest details of the 'catastrophe'. Titled \"NATO and the Destruction of Libya\", the lecture will take place in Saadu Zungur Auditorium at Mambayya House, Bayero University, Kano's Centre for Democratic Research and Training in the Department of Political Science. Mambayya House is the name of the residence of the late Mallam Aminu Kano. It was acquired by the Federal Government in the aftermath of the sage but vested in the Dept of Political Science at Bayero University, Kano. Left in a crisis of mission after engagements in Bosnia, then Afghanistan, then Libya and faced with the much talked about 'Russian threat' as well as the persistent attack on it by President Donald Trump, NATO could as well be one of the most interesting topics to listen to at a public lecture in an African university today.
