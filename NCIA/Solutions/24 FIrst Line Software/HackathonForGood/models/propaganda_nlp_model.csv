A loyal dog which has waited on a busy road for more than 80 days after its owner died there has captured the hearts of online communities in China. , 1
Footage of the animal in the middle of the road in Hohhot Inner Mongolia has been viewed 1.4 million times on the popular Sina Weibo microblog. , 1

US President Donald Trump has arrived in California to survey the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state's history. , 1
The Camp Fire in northern California has killed at least 71 people. , 1
More than 1000 people are reported to be missing although officials say that figure could fluctuate. , 1
Leaving for California Mr Trump again focused on forest management as a cause of the blazes a claim that has been disputed by experts. , 1
On top of the Camp Fire firefighters are also tackling several other blazes including the Woolsey Fire near Los Angeles which has claimed at least three lives.  , 1
And adding to the misery scores of people have become sick after outbreaks of the norovirus at shelters and the air quality in northern California has been rated the world's worst , 1
Heavy rain is forecast next week that could douse the flames but also bring mudslides and floods on hillsides stripped of vegetation. , 1
The death toll rose to 71 on Friday after seven more bodies were found in the town of Paradise which has been all but destroyed by the fire. , 1
Military troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains eight days on after the Camp Fire first broke out. , 1
Some of those on the list may be fine but unaware they have been reported missing or unable to call authorities say. , 1
The Camp Fire is now about 50% contained but fire officials say they may not have it fully under control until the end of the month. , 1
What kind of welcome will the president get? , 1
Mr Trump is due to meet survivors and firefighters involved in tacking the blaze when he touches down. , 1
Asked on Fox News if he thought climate change had contributed to the wildfires he said "Maybe it contributes a little bit. The big problem we have is management." , 1
California Governor Jerry Brown who has criticised this argument as simplistic said he would welcome the president to the state. , 1
"Now is a time to pull together for the people of California" he tweeted. , 1

While she backed Prime Minister Theresa May's efforts to get the "best possible deal" she warned the UK could not be "trapped" in an EU customs union. , 1
The BBC understands that Brexiteer Mrs Leadsom is part of a group of five ministers hoping to amend the deal. , 1
Despite widespread criticism of the draft withdrawal agreement Mrs May has vowed to "see it through". , 1
The 585-page document sets out the terms of the UK's departure including details such as how much money will be paid to the EU , 1

Environment Secretary Michael Gove is worried about treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. , 1
I think there's still the potential to improve on the clarification and on some of the measures within it and that's what I'm hoping to be able to help with. , 1
Among her concerns was that "the UK cannot be trapped in a permanent customs arrangement" with the EU she said. , 1
The UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent. , 1
The group's plans were described as a "work in progress" and a "last-ditch attempt to find something to put to the Commons". , 1
She also warned her opponents their alternative Brexit plans would not resolve the Irish backstop issue. , 1

Can artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning help save the world's bees? , 1
That's the hope of scientists who are scrambling to reverse the dramatic declines in bee populations. , 1
Bees are in trouble but we're not quite sure why. , 1
It could be the overuse of insecticides; air pollution; warming temperatures; the varroa destructor mite; or even interference from electromagnetic radiation. , 1
Or it could be a combination of all these factors. But until we have more data we won't know for sure. , 1
"Sound is probably the most important data set" he says. , 1
Oracle - which says the data will be owned by the World Bee Project - will use blockchain to verify that the data is coming from a particular hive and hasn't been tampered with. , 1
Simon Potts professor of biodiversity at Reading University says it can be quite hard with simple laboratory or field experiments to tease out what is affecting bees. , 1
The holy grail would be to indentify early warning indicators of problems. , 1
For instance when bees swarm the existing hive can lose half its population and half of its honey as those bees about to leave will gorge themselves first. , 1
So beekeepers want to minimise swarming. , 1
A beekeeper would then be able to take preventative action. , 1
And of the 100 crop species that feed 90% of the world's population 70 are pollinated by domesticated and wild bees. , 1
Honey bees are the single most important pollinator on the planet" says Prof Simon Potts. , 1
In the past 50 years the volume of agricultural production dependent on pollination has risen by 300% yet at the same time bee populations have plunged. , 1
Live monitoring would again allow earlier action to be taken in removing such predators. , 1
The team wants to understand phenomena such as colony collapse disorder which sees the worker bees disappearing and leaving the queen isolated. , 1
