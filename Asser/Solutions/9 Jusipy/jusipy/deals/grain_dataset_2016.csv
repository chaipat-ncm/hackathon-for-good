It had been pursuing the acquisition and development of oil palm plantations on more than 80,000 ha in West and Central Africa. In south-western Cameroon, the company acquired a 99 year lease for 73,000 ha adjacent to several important reserves, including the Korup National Park, where it planned to develop oil palm plantations. Environmental NGOs say these plantations will destroy forests and small farms in the area. In a meeting with investors in 2013, the company announced its intention to sell its entire 73,000 ha concession in 2018. However, after strong local opposition to the project, a presidential decree, also in 2013, reduced the size of the land concession granted to Herakles's subsidiary SG Sustainable Oils Cameroon to 19,843 ha on three-year probation period. The decree stipulated conditions, which the company failed to meet. In May 2015, Herakles stopped its operations in compliance with an order from the Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife. That year there were also reports that SG Sustainable Oils Cameroon was being acquired by Red Volta, the same company that had taken over Herakles' operations in Ghana.

Poligrow has acquired at least 5,600 ha of land, cultivating oil palm and jatropha on 3,700 ha. By December 2014, it had invested US$45 million in the project. The company intends to double the size of its plantations to more than 14,000 ha and build a much larger processing plant at Macondo. The three Macondo farms purchased by Poligrow in Mapiripan were designated as public lands for peasants in 1988-89, thus making their purchase illegal. Furthermore, the company�s plans are currently in limbo, due to irregularities in the Macondo land acquisitions of 2009, which amounted to 5,577 ha in total. Since Poligrow�s purchase the value of the land increased more than 12,000%. By 2015, a joint investigation by Colombian NGO Comisi�n Inter Eclesial de Justicia y Paz and the US-based NGO Environmental Investigation Agency found that Poligrow had contributed to forced displacement and land grabbing, and that its opponents have received death threats. However, the company intends to continue expanding its plantation over Las Toninas, opening a free trade zone near the lake that will allow for the processing and eventual export of palm oil from Mapirip�n.

Presently, the country's land law, which restricts foreign holdings to 1,000 ha, is holding them back. But the company hopes that a new bill, the proposed Zidres law, will allow them to lease the full 10,000 ha they have requested from the government.
