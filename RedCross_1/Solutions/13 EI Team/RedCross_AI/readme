We created a resmodel with Tensorflow containing 101 layers. We've ajusted it a bit to our requirements.
We have manually shifted the data Qgis and segmented the houses out of it with the geolocation.
For every key of the training set we took the amount of damage and linked it with an image and we
creater tensorflow file records with this. We removed some noise in  the data like images which are mostly black and images which are too small.
Lastly we've augmented the data with padding / rotation / flips / normalization.
