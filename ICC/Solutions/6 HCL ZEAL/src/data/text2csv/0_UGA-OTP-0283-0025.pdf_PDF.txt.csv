We called for camp residents to provide information to the block leaders of any properties stolen or damaged.

Annex ""J"" lists this information for Ogago parish; annex 4~K"" lists this information for Otok parish; annex \xc5\x81\'L"" lists this information for Paiula parish; and annex ""M"" lists this information for Palwo parish.

Some of the people included in this list have since left Pajule IDP camp. This list does not include the names of anybody who was abducted but did not receive a letter from a reception centre including those said to be released by Otti Vincent, nor does it include any of those abducted who may have not returned to Pajule IOP camp after their return from captivity. I obtained this list from my office where I had stored it as a sub-county record. 53. I attach as annex ""I"" the list of abductees who had been at reception centres and were reported as having returned to Pajule IDP camp. I started supervising the compilation of this list from 2003 and we continued recording this information until 2004. The staff at my office and I compiled this list at the request ofNGOs to confirm those abductees from Pajule IDP camp, who had been at the NGOs\' reception centres. We only recorded information of those abductees, who reported at our office themselves or relatives on their behalf) with a letter- from the abductee\'s reception centre. The block leader of that abductec\'s parish would record their information, unless the block leader delegated the task to somebody else (for example the block leader of Palenga parish has difficulty writing) or if they were not present somebody else in our office, including me, recorded it. 5 l. My office does not know how many people are still missing. Some of those returning from abduction were taken to the LC-3 office, and were then taken to the barracks to give information. However, I cannot be certain that al1 of those abductees returning went to the LC-3~s office. I was present at some of those times those abducted on 10 October 2003 returned and reported to the LC-3\'s office. Their particulars were taken such as their name, their age, their village and parish, their parents, the dare of their abduction, and leader of their group whilst they were in the bush under the LRA\'s captivity. 52. The camp commandant and block leaders of Lapul sub-county were also required under our regulations to record information for those abducted, huts burnt, people who died, and households looted. They should have the records of those reported by relatives as abducted from the four parishes of Lapui sub-county. The name of the current camp commandant of Lapul sub-county is Otika Terence Kanyum, I do not know of the numbers abducted from Lapul sub-county. '"

My vice camp commandant was present. He told me that at that meeting the UPDF said they were investigating what had happened but I never saw the results of those investigations.

I have lived in my present house located inside the trading centre since 1992. In 1997 my parents and half of the residents of what became Lapul came to the location of the current camp, but in the year 2000 most of the people went back home. I remained with my wife and children. Lapul IDP camp, which includes my home that I have lived in since l 992, came into existence in 2002. 8. There have been many attacks on the Pajule-Lapul IDP camps and it is hard for me to remember the dates. One attack took place on 23 January 2003, and I was present during this attack. There have been other attacks when I have been present. and others when I have not been present in the camp. 9.

Ocan BUNIA was leading Gilva, and we were told he was in Katakwi, so understood that some from Gilva were moving with some from Trinkle. I met BUNIA later and not in Katakwi. 9. I think that from the girls who were first abducted, which I believe were more than 100, I saw more than thirty girls released myself although I was not so much focused on how many girls were being released. However, I am not certain. I think about thirty girls remained after the release. Some other girls had escaped along the way, 7.

The latrine was around 4 meters from my house, in the direction of the barracks. On the other side, about 3 meters further, you had a kraa1, where animals would stay during the 15. The house was around 300 meters away from the barracks. The doorfrarne of my house was made of palm-tree and the shutter was made out of iron sheets. The door, that was old, had a round hole of around 10 cm. diameter in the iron sheet. The door was facing the barracks. 14. My house was around 12 feet diameter. In the middle of the house there was a pillar supporting the roof. 13. At the time l arrived in the camp, the area had not yet been divided into zones, but my house was near the road from GULU to AJULU. lt was on the same side of the road as the school and the barracks - on the side where the sun rises. Only few houses are on the other side of the road, mainly houses that had been there before the camp was established, The soldiers asked the owners of these houses to move to the other side of the road, so that all the houses would be on the same side. The trading center is on the other side of the road. The barracks and the trading center are more into the direction of GULU and my house was more into the direction of AJULU. Location and description of the house in LUKODI camp 12. Some of my children were attending schools in GULlJ town, which was too far away from AJULU camp so in 2003 I decided to build a house in LUKODl camp and moved there with my youngest child Milly. Florence was at that lime living with her brother Justine in LAU Y A-DWOL village. In the weekend Florence often visited me in the camp when she was collecting firewood and food. 11. Around 3 years later, T moved from PARANGA village to AJULU camp. Rebels were abducting people, and the soldiers told us that the government had implemented a directive that people had to move within 24 days to a camp. So we followed the directive and I moved with all my children to AJULU camp. This camp is in the same sub-county as PARJ\\NGA village, about 3.5 miles away, so that is why l decided to move to that camp. We stayed in AJULU camp for about 3.5 years. 10. After around 2 years, we moved from GULU town back to PARANGA village. - OOLA Justine (male, 12 years old, he lives with the brother of his father in KASUBT village. He goes to school in GULU Public Primary School); - ANEK Milly (female, 8 years old, she died during the May 2004 incident); and - KOMAKECI I (male, without a first name, died at the age of 3, prior to the incident). 9. In 1996, we moved away from PARANOA village and went to GULU town. MUSEVENI had come into power and the insurgencies had started. 1997, my husband died in GULU town.

When I try to find out this information, I work through the LC-2s and the councilors from each parish. They seek this information on my behalf from the LC-1 chairpersons. Each LC- I chairperson would call for a meeting of each village to find out the information, together with the camp commandant and relevant block leaders who are also present at these meetings.

There have been four heavy attacks by the rebels at Pajule IDP camp: on 10 September 2002. 27 November 2002, 23 January 2003, and 10 October 2003. I heard from returning abd.uctees abducted from each respective attack, that the attack on LO September 2002 was led by Dominic Ongwen, 27 November 2002 was led by Raska Lukwiya, 23 January 2003 was led by Tabuley, and 10 October 2003 was led by Otti Vincent. 1 heard these returning abductees provide this information for myself, when we asked for the names of the commanders leading the attacks. J cannot recall any of their names or when they provided this information to me. There have been no further significant attacks at Pajule JDP camp after this date. I was present at the camp during the September 2002 and January 2003 attacks. Since June 2002, when the rebels were returning from Sudan there have also been minor incidents where the rebels come to steal food from the camp residents. These incidents of looting happen from time to time. It is unpredictable as to when such an incident will happen, for example sometimes they come two times in a week to steal food if they did not succeed in stealing food the first time. There have also been ambushes around the camp with people being killed. Attack 10 Oetober 2003: Previous Approaches 12. Prior to the attack on 10 October 2003 I did not have any information about a potential attack against Pajule.

The gunshots continued in the same intermittent way until about six o\'clock in the morning. That is when I heard gunshots coming from the side of Lira. from the main road. I couJd also hear shouting in Ki-Swahili, which I do not understand. After that I heard a helicopter roaring above, but I did not see it because I was still in my house. The government soldiers shouting in Ki-Swahili began to pass my house; some were moving on the main road; and some on the other side of the main road. I could hear them moving, although [ did not see them. After they had passed my house, I could hear the sounds of guns going off again. 15. After the soldiers had passed I got up because 1 thought it was clear now and it was also past daybreak. I am not aware of the exact time. but I assume it was around seven o\'clock in the morning. I went outside where I could see also other people coming out of their houses. I could see the community leaders beginning to gather to see what had happened. I headed off to see my parents, and met them inside their house. After their place I proceeded to my brother\'s house to check on his wife and children, and found them all outside. I asked whether anything bad had happened. and they told the door was not broken, but a bullet had been shot through. Then I returned home. other two rooms. My parents who also live in the camp were in a different house. My house is located on the Lapul IDP camp side of the main road. within the trading centre. 11. I first became aware of an attack beginning when 1 heard guns being fired around five o\'clock in the morning. lam not sure of the time. because I do not have a watch, but I am usually awake at that time. ln addition to the sound of guns I also heard the sounds of whistles being blown and ululations of the \'kijera\' style. The sounds seemed at first to be coming from the west side of the camp. from the direction of the barracks. After a while, I heard gunshots and ululations coming from all other directions. 12. When the sounds of the gunshots ceased for a period, I heard loud hitting on the doors of houses. Then the gunshots went off again. This continued for a while. Every time the guns fell silent, J could hear the hitting of the doors again. After about thirty minutes. I heard my elder boys in my house calling for me shouting that we should run out Three of them began to run, but I managed to puII one of them into my room and stuck him under a bed. After five minutes I heard a bullet hitting the padlock of my door and the door being opened. My thought was that this time I would either be killed or abducted, and I told my wife to pray. [began to make the sign of the cross. I heard somebody saying that there was nothing in here and they went away. These rebels were speaking in Acholi. I also heard someone else saying not far from my house ""let that Muzee carry the sodas"". Then these rebels went away. 13. I know the attackers to the camp were rebels because of the noises they were making. They were blowing whistles and they had girls with them making the sound of \'kijera\' ululations. This is what usually happens when the rebels attack. Witness statemenl ofOTlKA Terence Kanyum '"

The other two groups who record these same records are the disaster management committee (administrative structure) and the scounty loca] council authorities (the LCs). We work together with the LCs and others when compiling our information, although we write our own separate records. 10. ln the camp structure, at the Pajule sub-county level there is the camp commandant who is me. There is also a vice camp commandan1, the general secretary, women\'s leader for the camp, and block leaders for each parish (or \'blocks\'). There are six parishes of Pajule sub-county at the camp_ This fa at the sub-county level. The block leader is the leader of the parish group and he has village leaders he works with.

Lapul IDP camp also has its own camp structure. and its camp commandant and block leaders who would also have recorded their own information related to the attack. In addition, the disaster management committee and the LCs for Lapul sub-county would also have made a record of information relevant to the attack at the Lapul sub-county side of the camp. Attack 11. I think that the attacks of 23 January 2003 and 10 October 2003 were the two most severe attacks at the camp. 12. Independence Day is celebrated on 9 October, and it was on the morning of 10 October 2003 just as some people were still celebrating in the camp and some were drunk when the rebels came. 13. I was present during the attack at the camp on 10 October 2003. There are several places I sleep in at the camp, because of my concern that rebels not find where I am living. The hut that I was sleeping in at the time of the attack was near the Lira road. I was with all my children except for one child. My wife and one child were at Kitgum hospital. I only had my other children with me and nobody else, The attack came from all directions in the camp. 14. I could hear shooting first from the direction of the barracks, but I do not know if it was the rebels or UPDF who started shooting at the barracks. I could then hear shooting coming from di rferent directions. This happened between 5 and 6 am. When I heard the gunshots my children and T lay on the floor. I could hear rebels giving instructions ""you just abduct, maka maka"", and giving instructions to other rebels that they should just shoot the drunkards. l knew then that these were rebels attacking the camp. The rebels did not enter my hut or open the room that I was in with my children, 15. I could hear people shouting names of those who had been abducted. The rebels had started abducting people, looting things and forcing abductees to carry loot as the army who is meant to protect the camp had run away. I was later told by people who had been abducted how they had been forced to carry loot and doors were broken. I could hear the doors being broken as places were being looted. I '"

I believe that the first time I saw OTI( was about one week after my abduction, in Pader district. I cannot remember where in Pader I saw him, but I think it was in Patongo, Pader district. I think that it could have been in Lukole, which I believe is in Patongo, When arriving at Lukole in Pader district I was swapped into OTTI's household. I remember now that I heard that KONY was in Kitgum when I saw OTTl for the first time in Pader; and not when I was in Orungo, Katakwi, I did not see OITI in Orungo in Katakwi district after our abduction. I had thought OITI was in Katakwi because I heard somebody speaking to him on the radio call when we were in Katakwi; but did not see him there myself. 16. The commanders that I remember traveling with us from Katakwi towards OITI in Pader included T ABULEY, KAPERE, OKUTI and LABONGO. 17. I recall that not all ofus Lwala girls remaining in the bush were taken to OTTI. Just before reaching OTTJ, only a few of us Lwala girls were selected to go to Meeting Kape.-e and Tabulu_ 10. After I was abducted I was taken to KAPERE and that night I slept where he was. The following day some of the girls were released. The girls were released by KAPERE. OKUTI later showed me T ABULEY, and 1 believe he was a person we were showed as being in our group shortly after we were abducted. But I cannot recall exactly when I saw TABULEY myself the first time. Before we were taken to OTII I think we stayed with TABULEY for about one or two weeks. 11. I believe we were thirty girls because KAPERE kept on counting and confirming the number of girls; including the thirty girls remaining. After the thirty was counted a few more people escaped. We were collected again and we were counted again. After the count I think we remained with about twenty girls from Lwala School, but I am not certain. 12. I heard a commander on the radio call who was informing other commanders that the girls were being brought to Sudan. I only reca1led what was said in Acholi and they then switched over to speaking in Arabic, which I could not understand. 13. l remember saying last time, that after the radio call that I believed the commander who spoke on the radio call was saying afterwards to other commanders that only thirty girls bad to remain and seventy girls had to be released. However, I cannot remember the exact number of girls remaining and being released; but believe that the numbers released was just more than thirty and those remaining were about thirty. TABULEY had said some would first be released, then the rest be released later. I do not recall him saying to us that seventy would be released. 14. I think that traveling from where we first met KAPERE to where we met TABULEY was a short distance; about four kilometers. 4 Witness statement of] """

When they shouted that everyone had to 24. 1 could see that all five of them had similar guns, the size of an under-arm. They were holding their guns in one hand. I did not see them carrying whistles. 23. Around 1930 hrs. - 2000 hrs, I saw -through the hole in my door- five rebels coming from the house next door straight into the direction of my house. They were shouting that everyone should come outside of their houses. All five were bare-chested adult men, and they had tied their shirts around their waists. Two of them had military trousers in camouflage color and dreadlocks. The other three had civilian trousers and short hair. I could not distinguish one of them giving orders to the others. 22. The whole period between 1800 hrs. and 1930 hrs., I stayed inside my house with the door closed. Florence and Milly were with me. Florence, who does not live with me in the camp had come that Saturday to collect firewood close to the camp. I didn't run away because they were shooting outside and I was afraid of being hit. 21. Around 1900 hrs. - 1930 hrs., the gunshots coming from the direction of the barracks stopped and 1 heard only gunshots from the direction where the sun rises, After the incident, I was told that around I 930 hrs. the soldiers had run away towards the direction where the sun sets. 20. Tt seemed to me that the rebels -Iocated in the direction where the sun rises- and the soldiers -located in the barracks- were shooting at each other. I heard gunshots from one side, being responded by gunshots from the other side. In general, though, the gunshots mainly came from the side of the barracks. 19. Shortly afterwards, the whistling and the alarm had stopped, and I heard gunshots instead corning from both the barracks and from the direction where the sun rises. 18. I know it was around 1800 hrs. because that was the time that the soldiers would usually return to the barracks, and they had just returned. I was inside my house with Florence and Milly. At that time. I heard the rebels blowing the whistles and then making 'the alarm': I mean thereby shouting 'uuuuu' while putting one hand on and off the mouth. I also heard camp residents shouting 'lakwena, lakwena', I stayed inside my house, but could see through the hole in my door that camp residents were running around. 17. On 20 May 2004, around 1800 hrs. l was preparing a meal. On normal days, 1 would have the meal around I 400 hrs. - 1500 hrs. but that day l had picked up food from P ARAN GA village, so T prepared the food later than usual. May 2004 attack night.

On the way to my parents' and my brother's place, I did not see any dead or injured people.

I started going towards the barracks. because [ was worried for my two children, who had run out of our house and had not yet come back. When I reached the shelter. the soldiers were refusing to Jet the people move ahead and blocking the way to the barracks. At that time 1 heard that one of my sons OCA YA had returned, so I did not proceed all the way to where the soldiers were and went back home where I found both my sons had returned. 19. When I got back home. people were seated outside. We understood the commander of the government army. Paul LOKECH. had arrived and gone to the barracks. 20. When the government soldiers returned to the camp we began to look around and see what had happened. That is when we began to hear news of the abductions. I was told my neighbour OY AT Masimino had been taken to carry sodas. At the time l got back home, OYA T had returned, so I went up to him and asked how he had returned. He told me he had escaped when the helicopter had hovered around them causing the rebels to seek cover. He had escaped during one of these moments. like certain other abducted people. OY AT told me that he saw many abducted people escape this way but he had also seen the rebels go off with a large number of people. OYAT also said that when the helicopter came the rebels had begun torching houses on Pajule side. 21. Among the abductees was also Rwot OYW AK Joseph. When people heard he had been abducted. they began to gather in his home, thinking he would return soon. Towards the evening we received the word that some people had returned, but that the rebels had refused to release the Rwot. After hearing this. some of the people began to go back to their homes to finish off the food and drinks, since the previous day had been Independence Day and there had been celebrations. 22. I know abducted people were killed on the way when they were taken by the rebels. Among the killed was a typist from Pajule who had been born in Lapul and was called LACUNG. I could see the family of LACUNG gathering to go and see the place where he had been killed. They set off and collected his dead body. He was buried the next day; we all attended the funeral. 'When I saw the body, it was wrapped, but the brother of the dead person, OKEMA 0 Ben, told me LACUNG had been shot in the back. OKEMA told me he had collected the body from the road. He also told me that the leaders had told him the body should just have been left where it was and covered with leaves according to the Acholi custom, but OKEMA had refused and brought the body home.

The CO of the military barracks at the camp told us later that rebels had laid ambushes on the roads around the camp to prevent any army from coming inside.

Rebels were now running away from the anny.

Returning abductees later told us that when the remaining rebels saw the helicopter they started retreating. 17. I was later told on the same day of the attack by the CO of the military barracks, that he told those in the helicopter not to shoot at the rebels as there was a mixture of camp residents abducted and rebels moving below. He also said that those in the helicopter could see civilians carrying World Food Programme bags of food. 18. Government soldiers brought in from outside the camp were following the rebels who were moving with abducted people. Those camp residents who were left behind started coming out of their huts, including me. I could see rebels walking on the Pajule side of the camp where there were cultivated fields on raised ground and abducted people moving away with the rebels carrying stolen loot. I could see the helicopter hovering over these people. The helicopter was not shooting at them, but was shooting ahead of them where it could not hurt them. I tbink the helicopter was firing to scare off the rebels. I could see where the helicopter was shooting from a distance. The abductees were about a balfto one kilometre away from me where 1 was at the trading centre, when I saw the helicopter. Abductees who escaped said that at the time the helicopter was dropping bombs, the rebels were instructing the people including those in the sorghum fields lo lie down. At that point, some people were able to escape. Abductees returning later told us that some of them were tied together by the rebels to stop them from running away, but once given a load to carry the ties were removed and they were gathered together as they walked with the loot. 19. Abductees who later returned and the government army later told us that government soldiers walking on foot, were firing in the air so they would not hurt the civilian abductees and did so under orders. I did not see this for myself, but 1 could hear them firing as they were going. 20. Among the abducted was the paramount Chief (Rwot) Oywak. 1 was told by the Rwot and other abductees that after they had traveled for about 8 kilometres the rebels allowed them to rest when they realized the army was not following them. They said that different groups of abductees were resting separately. They said that when some of the rebels recognized Rwot Oywak, that he was taken to where '"

I do not have any other information about his release. I do not know why Otti released them 20. After the attack on l 0 October 2003, the LRA wrote a letter saying that they wanted to come back again to attack Pajule in October 2003. I think it stated they would return on 25 October 2003, but I am not certain. I cannot recall now who had signed the letter. I think that children going to school found the letter on the road between the trading centre and the barracks within Pajule IDP camp. I cannot recall the date but think it was after the attack on I 0 October 2003. I think it was on 14 October 2003. I saw the letter m.yself on about 14 October 2003. The children gave the letter to the GISO who gave it to me and we brought it together to give it to the CO ofHote] Battalion at the barracks, Captain Lubwama, so they could prepare for the attack again if it came. That letter made a lot of people leave the camp for places like Bweyale in Masindi district. I do not have a copy of that letter. Records from Odober 2003 21. I attach as annex ""A"" an original record of people listed as abducted on IO October 2003 during the attack by the LRA, from the six parishes of Pajule subcounty within Pajule IDP camp, according to each ward. This record started being compiled from IO October 2003 to about 15 October 2003. This information about the people who were abducted was provided by some of the relatives of those abducted to some of the LC-1 s of the villages. These LC-1 chairpersons would bring these relatives of those abducted to the LC-3 office. The information contained in annex \'A\' was then recorded by my three secretaries at the LC-3 office, namely Labeja B. Johnson, Margaret Okwera Mrs, and Komakech Johnson. I am not certain if it was the relatives themselves directly or the LC-ls or both who provided this information to the secretaries. However, both relatives and LC-1 s would be present in the office when this information was recorded. UGA.00138.007 I rHlll 11111llifl1111111111111 '"

We also heard that people had died on the Pajule side, and the parents of the dead began to go to that direction. One of the dead people in Pajule called OJOK Patrick was from Lapul side and his name is included in the records of the dead people I have provided to the investigators. 24. Another person I heard being killed was APANG, and he was from the Pajule side of the camp. I am not aware of any details of his death. The people who brought the news of the death ofLACUNG told us about this other death. 25. Around five o'clock in the afternoon we began to hear gunshots again. The gunshots were coming from the middle of the trading centre. I hid in the bush with my family, but the next day I was told that it had been the government soldiers shooting in the air. J was wondering why the government soldiers would be shooting in the air after something bad had happened, but I was told then that the commander, LOKECH. had entered the barracks and congratulated his soldiers on how they had repelled the rebels who entered the barracks. The soldiers were drunk and shooting for joy. 26. r have no knowledge of the LRA commanders or groups taking part in the attack of October 2003. Sources of information pertaining to attacks on camps: 27. When an attack happens in a camp, the information of the attack is passed on to the office of the camp commandant, the office of the LC3, and the Disaster Management Committee, which are three separate chains of reporting. 28. Information reaching the camp commandant is collected directly and/or through block leaders, who in tum coJlect it from village leaders. Blocks are equivalents of parishes. There are four blocks in Lapul sub-county. Ogole parish is referred to as Block G, Atoo as Block H; Koyo as Block I, and Luk.aci as Block J. All block leaders who were in office during the attack are still around. 29. The previous camp commandant of Lapul was called ANYWAR Joseph, and he died in March 2003 of disease. I was elected camp commandant on 12 December 2003, and I assumed office on 20 December 2003. During the attack in October 2003, the deputy to the camp commandant, ONE.KA David, was acting camp commandant. He was replaced at the time l was elected, and he left to Bweyale in Masindi District. 30. The office of the LC3 (sub-county level) collects its information through the Local Council (LC) structure, i.e. through parishes (LC2) and villages (LCl ). The LC structure is separate to the camp structure in acquiring information. However, my predecessor as camp commandant, ANYW A~ held also the position of the chairperson of LC3, and during the time of the attack since ANYW AR was dead, the vice LC3 chairperson was in charge. The vice LC3 chairperson is called Mrs Helen OPW AR~ and she is also the vice LC3 chairperson today. The current LC3 chairperson is called OTOO Paul Komakech, and he has been elected only recently to the office. In addition to holding the office of LC3, OTOO is also my deputy camp commandant in the Witness statement of OTIKA Terence Kan yum """

Returning abductees had told us that other commanders at the attack included Raska Lukwiya and Charles Tabuley. I recall that Rwot Oywak, Kitara Francis and Okot Dick were amongst abductees I heard say this. 21. Rwot Oywak. told us he then begged Otti Vincent to release the abductees. Ail the abduetees slept in the bush with the rebels and on 11October2003 at about l lam, Rwot Oywak said that Otti agreed to reJease some of the abductees, l do not know how many of these abductees were released. but Rwot Oywak told me about 500 had been released. The people who were released were ferried by vehicle. Some were taken to the Caritas reception centre. There were some abductees who escaped when the helicopter came and came back to the camp on their own. 22. Abductees who were released informed us about the release. It was Rwot Oywak who told us that it was Otti Vincent who agreed to release those from his group. The other abductees did not say they knew for themselves that it was Otti Vincent who released them, as the discussion between the Rwot Oywak and Otti Vincent was not in the open. 23. Rwot Oywak also told me that after releasing his group of abductees, Otti Vincent had said he would see how they could release the remaining abductees but that they must first carry the looted things. 24. Abductees continued to escape and come back from the bush. Some returning would report to the office of the LC-3, some would go straight home, and some would run to other camps which are not very far from the camp. such as Pader town council camp, Acholi-Bur, and Comer Kilak, Some got into vehicles and went further to places like Masindi district and Lira district. 25. After the rebels had left the camp, I started moving around to find out where people had died. I first went to the lower side of the camp in Lapul sub-county by the barracks with other sub-county leaders and we found dead bodies. I saw dead bodies lying at a distance of about 10 metres from the barracks. The army did not allow people including us to move closer, so we could not determine which bodies were those of civilians and which were those of the army. There were some amongst the dead outside the barracks wearing civilian clothes. We were told by the anny that those outside the barracks, including those wearing civilian clothes, were LRA rebels that the army had killed, When we reached there, the army was already taking the bodies from outside the barracks into the barracks. 26. As one of the camp leaders I was later told by the military that there were civilians amongst the dead killed inside the barracks, as we must know which camp residents are alive or dead. The bodies of the civilians were brought to us from the barracks. 1 understand that they were killed when the rebels had been throwing bombs inside the barracks. These were the civilians who were killed in the barracks that we were informed about. The army told us there were 11 killed outside the barracks. 27. On the day after the attack, I saw on the upper side to the north of Paiule IDP camp the dead body of a businessman, Onek Pangrasio (about half a kilometre '"

I saw again in Omot, bordering Lira and Pader whilst I was in the sickbay; but they were not in the sickbay with me as well. Release of girls 30. After the group of girls were released by .KAPERE in Katakwi, I recall hearing from T ABU LEY a short time later that all of us girls were to be released. l cannot recall exactly what he said but I believe he said that KONY ordered that all of us Lwala girls who were abducted were to be released. We were told that the Lwala girls not selected to move on after leaving Katak:wi were being released then and those of us selected to move onwards (to Pader) would be released later. However, I believe that none of them remaining behind were released, as I met some of them later whilst we were still in the bush. 31. The names of girls who staved behind and who were not selected to go to OTTI that I can recall include 25. I do not remember very well where I was taken after Palabek, but I think that it was in Atiak. 26. After Palabek I met KONY a second time in Uganda I cannot remember where it was, but [ remember crossing a certain road to reach him. I think that this second time I met him was about one month after the first time we met. During this second time I saw KONY, I also saw/ ,At this time I was in OTTT's household. There were many soldiers there, both times I met KONY in Uganda. 27. During this time period between the first and second time I met KONY~ most of the time OTTI was with us. 28. I remember seeing KONY only twice. After the second time meeting KONY, I do not know whether he was staying in Uganda or was going somewhere else. But KONY separated from OTfI. At this time I was still with OITI's group. 29.I went to Sudan, as KONY went to Sudan. I know I who studied at the same school who was also abducted, but I do not remember now whether she was brought to Sudan. 6 Witness statement o~ """

There were also two soldiers wounded during the incident who were in the barracks. J slept in one of the houses of the barracks. The soldiers gave me two Paracetamol. The next morning, at around 0600 hrs. the soldiers went back in the lorry to LUKODI camp, and picked up more injured people from there. The soldiers told us that the lorry had left again for LUKODT. 40. We waited for a while in the vehicle for the other soldiers to arrive. We were still on the road inside the camp. After a while, the other soldiers arrived and we left for COOPRE camp. I was in the lorry with around 20 soldiers and one other civilian: a small girl of whom the mother had run away. We arrived around 2200 hrs. in COOPEE camp after having driven around for a while. On my way to COOPEE camp, from the vehicle, I saw the houses burning in LUKODl camp. 39. When we arrived at the lorry. the soldiers told me: ""Woman, we can not take this child with us"". As they explained, the government does not a11ow that. So they took my child to the mango tree near the main road on the side where the sun rises. J was told later that my child was brought the next day to LALTY A-DWOL and buried there. 38. My house was near the road and I shouted \'Help me, J am shot, I am a civilian and 1 am here\'. It took a while before they heard me. I was still at the latrine. A group of around IO soldiers found me. They first carried my child to the vehicle (that I later realized was a lorry) and then they came back to carry me. When they had found me, I asked the soldiers to get a blanket from my house to cover the corpse of my child. Rescue 37. I had heard that the vehicle stopped and that the soldiers had come outside. I then heard people speaking Acholi and Swahili on the road. r heard them saying in Acholi: \'The soldiers ol\'LUKODI have all run away. It is better to come back tomorrow morning and look for them then\'. I realized that these were not the rebels because l had heard the helicopter, the mamba and a vehicle, and rebels do not have these means of transportation. 36. After around 30 minutes, I also heard that a vehicle came and stopped on the road. Later, when the soldiers took me to the road, I realized that the vehicle was a Jorry. It was a typical military lorry that normally carries soldiers. 35. While the helicopter was still around, l heard a mamba, but 1 did not see it. T heard that the mamba was going towards the direction of UNYAMA River. 1 heard that it stopped at some point and then T could hear it coming back towards the direction of the camp. 34. During the whole time T was laying down next to the latrine, l saw the light of burning houses on the side where the sun rises and at the location where the barracks were. 1 could see that my house was not burned. My knee was painful and bleeding. Witness statement of A YAA Pyerina '"

LC3 's office will have originals of their own records received through the LC structure pertaining to the attack in October 2003. 31. The Disaster Management Committee, which is a sub-county level management committee, is headed by the Sub-county Chief. The Committee represents a third separate source of information, and it receives its information either directly from individuals or from the parish chiefs. During the attack of October 2003 the Committee was headed by the previous Sub-County Chief called OYET, who was also present during the attack. OYET has been transferred and he is now the Sub-County Chief of Parabongo sub-county in Agago County. Parler District. I believe the current Sub-County Chief shouJd have access to any records, which would have been compiled in relation to the October 2003 attack. Tue current Sub-County chief is called AKONGO Eunice and she took office in 2004. 32. A fourth source of information for records pertaining to attacks on camps are the community volunteer councillors (CVC), a concept introduced by an Italian NGO called A VSJ. The CVC's are local volunteers who compile their records e.g. when attacks take place in the camps. The CVC's provide these records directly to AVSI, but also keep their own copies. 33. When [ came into office, [ asked the acting camp commandant ONEKA to hand over all records to me. The only records he provided to me were the numbers of the people in the camp in the document, which l have provided to the investigators. I never saw any records that may have been kept by my predecessor ANYW AR. 34. My secretary OKEMA 0 Ben, brother of the late LACUNG. is a community volunteer councillor in addition to being the secretary of the camp. I assigned OKEMA, on about 25 June 2004, as responsible for recording any abductions from Lapul IDP camp and recording return of abductees. 35. After the request from the ICC for me to provide records relevant to the attack on Lapul IDP camp in October 2003, I asked OK.EMA 0 Ben to provide this information. 36. OKEMA wrote down the information I requested. copying it from original records to which he had access at the office of the eve. This information he copied is contained in documents that I have provided to the investigators as originals. As OKEMA copied the information at the CVC offices, I believe the CVC records would have been his primary source of information. OK.EMA might have had access or included through some other means also certain records of the former vice camp commandant or camp commandant, but 1 am not sure. In his position as the secretary of the camp, OKEMA would have had access on1y to information related to the camp structure, not to the LC structure information. 37. l have provided the investigators the original documents the camp secretary OKEMA compiled on my request as described above.

I saw the body after his brother had turned the body around and the body was covered with a blanket. We asked for the blanket to be removed and it was. I saw the dead body was lying sideways. The head was swollen. The body was all bloody sol could not tell where the blood was coming from. The brother told us that before we reached the body the brother had turned round the body and found that Pangrasio had been shot in the back. 28. After this, in the afternoon I saw the dead body of the sub-county typist \xc5\x81 .Kinyera Lacung, I saw the body in his home, after it had been carried from the bush to his home. The body had been wrapped so l could not see the wounds and T could not see his face. His relatives who brought his body back said that his head had been beaten, and that his body was found about one kilometre away from the Pajule side of the camp where he had been killed. I cannot recall his relatives' names at this moment. 29. We were later told by returning abductees that Lacung had been killed by rebels because he could not carry the load he was given by them. They said the rebels used a club to kill him and brought the club with them. I heard them as they spoke but I cannot reca11 any of their names. I do not know why Pangrasio was killed. 30. I understand that Pangrasio was Jater buried by his relatives at the site where he was killed, after his identification, as it is the Acholi culture that if somebody is killed they are not buried at their home compound. I understand that Lacung was buried in the cemetery. 31. There were reports of other dead bodies found in various places near by the camp, on the route taken by the rebels but I did not go to see them myself. But many other camp residents went to check whether these dead people were related to them. By 11 October 2003 I had received information about nine of the dead from Pajulc sub-county, which I recorded. 32. The camp residents could not see anybody killed if the bodies were much farther along the route taken by the rebels where it was not safe to go further. However, reports were coming back. from abductees who returned, about other abductees, who they said had been killed by rebels for example for trying to escape or for not being able to walk any more. T cannot recall the names of any of the returned abductees I heard this from or names of abductees they said they saw killed in this way. 33. Once a dead person was identified we informed relatives that they could bury their dead. I am not certain if this was on the same day of the attack, but it was most Likely to have been on the following morning. 34. On the day of the attack, everybody including me was busy checking on their relatives to ensure they were all there. This was when I was starting to receive reports as to who had not been seen and who had been abducted. 35. After checking on my relatives, I went with others to see the huts that were burnt and other things that were destroyed on that day. """

During this time period I do not remember whether we went back to Lango with OTfl, but we did not return to Teso. During this period I was in OTTI's group and I stayed in his household. OTII was the group leader and he remained with us. 39. I recall that the commanders involved in the Pajule attack besides OITI were Raska LUKWIY A and ACEL CALO AP AR. Just before the attack at Pajule I heard OTTI give the orders to abduct. Some time before the attack I also heard him tell one of his favourite wives that KONY had said there were already enough women in the bush so that they did not need to abduct any more women. 40. I have heard of Dominic ONG WEN, but I never saw him. I have heard of ODOMI and even saw him but I cannot remember where this was. 33. The rest of those girls I mentioned who were not selected to meet OTTI, I do not recall seeing again in the bush after we had been selected to go meet OTTI. I learnt later that is dead. She was staying with T ABU LEY. The wives of T ABU LEY took her to OKUTI' s household after T ABULEY' s death. I met-~n OKUTl's household after T ABU LEY died. I met some of the girls who were in OKUTI's household after they escaped and they told me that 1-~as killed by a gunship in Pader.

She was not killed when we were on the way to om in Pader after we were first abducted. 34. I have never seen o~ since I last saw them when we left to meet OTTI.

When we came to where OTil was in Pader; LABONGO who had brought us to this location told us that we had to rise early the next morning because we were going to be released. Y ARDIN, who died, had also previously said to us that we would be released. OITI was not with us, but was not far from our group sitting with other commanders, when LABONGO told us girls that we were going to be released. 37. But when we met OTII he would not allow us to be released. We were deceived when we were told we would be released.

Amongst them were ONEK, an old man; OLANYA MUGWANY (lam not sure which one is the last name); ORYEM; OKlJMU; and a girl whose name I do not remember. 49. I was the last one of all the patients injured in LUKODI camp being dismissed from the hospital. Florence was discharged after one month. They trimmed her toes. It healed well and she is now in school in LALIYA-DWOL. After she was discharged, she stayed with me in the hospital to take care of me. Most of the other people who were with me in the hospital went afterwards to COOPEE camp. Some of them may be in LUKODI camp, but Tam not sure. As far as I know nobody else left the two camps to live elsewhere, like me. 48. Thal same day, no other injured people from LUKODl camp were brought to the OULU Main Hospital. The next day, one woman, whose legs were stubbed was brought to the hospital. She used to cook in one of the hotels of LUKODI, but l do not remember her name. She survived. 47. J joined the group of injured people in the vehicle. We were brought to GULU Main (Referral) Hospital. The two injured soldiers who had spent the night with me m COO PEE camp were carried in another vehicle and brought to the military hospital. 46. My daughter explained to me in the vehicle that Milly had been found earlier that morning under the mango tree and that the son of my sister and his sister-in-law had carried her to LALIYA-DWOL to be buried. Florence said that she had slept during the night outside of the camp, near LUKOME River. When she had come back from the bush, the body of Milly had already been removed. She did not tell me anything else about what had happened. She only said that, in the morning, she had seen the vehicle that brought her to COOP EE camp. 45. One of the girls was shot in the chest. Another one was hit in the thigh. The leg of the third girl was burned. My daughter was shot and hit at the two bigger toes of her left foot. 44.

Abductions of people: 38. The first document I have provided is titled \'Data of abducted people from 2003 and 2004\'. The document includes information from three of the four parishes of Lapul sub-county: Ogole, Koyo, and Lukaci. I am not certain if OKEMA has further information about abductions from Atoo parish for 2003. 39. I cannot say the exact number of people who were abducted in October 2003. I was not yet at the time the camp commandant and was not involved in the process of calculating numbers abducted or of those who returned. I did not make any notes of the numbers or other information pertaining to the abductions at the time. The records I showed to the investigators indicate that seven individuals from Lapul IDP camp were reported as being abducted on 10 October 2003. In my view this cannot be the total number, since I am aware that many more were abducted from Lapul IDP camp during the October 2003 attack. 40. I never saw abductees being taken out of the camp, because I was still inside my house when this happened. However, I estimate that around 700 people were abducted altogether from both of the camps on I 0 October 2003. T am basing my estimate on the information given by the people who returned and on the information conveyed to me by the Rwot upon his return. 41. The primary source of information about an abducted person is usually the relatives of that person, who report the abduction either directly to the camp commandant or to the lower levels. Only information about an abduction that has been specifically reported to one of these officials is recorded. Some relatives never report the abductions, which means information can be missing from the official records. 42. I am not aware of the number of groups of abductees, which were taken out of the camp and in which direction they left, since I was not outside my house when this happened. 43. I was not present when the released people came back, but the Rwot told me th.e same day he was released that he came back with about 400 people. He came back with elder people and women with children who had been abducted. Most of those released were women. 44. The second docwnent I have provided is titled ""Data of people abducted in the year 2002"", and the information pertains to the parishes of Ogole, Koyo, Lukaci and Atoo. People killed: 45. The third document I have provided is a list titled \'Data of peopJe killed in the camp attack IO. l0.2003\'.

The relatives of the dead people were called to come to my office by the block leaders and started coming the day after the attack.

However, the relatives confirmed the details of their dead relatives. The LCs were present when the relative for a d((~d person would Records 39. I attach as annex ""A"" a list compiled by me of camp residents from the Pajule sub-county side of the camp who were killed on 10 October 2003 by LRA rebels within the camp. The list includes some civilians killed within the Lapul side of the camp if they were Pajule sub-county residents. Otherwise, I do not know how many people died in the Lapul sub-county side of the camp that day. 1 started compiling this list from 10 October 2003. The first nine names in this list include those civilians killed at the military barracks. I compiled this information by first moving around the camp to identify dead people with block leaders, LCs and others. I would ask those block leaders from Pajule sub-county who I met if any camp residents had died in their ward. Not all block leaders were present as some had been abducted. I was only checking those people killed and other losses at this time, so only wrote this information later when I was in my office rather than when I was going around the camp. 36. When I went to my own home to check the damage caused by the attack, I saw that grass had been pulled from the thatched roof of m.y hut. My relative, called Obel, who was in this hut of mine during the attack told me that he heard what the rebels were saying when they saw the heJicopter. He said that he heard a commander say ""you burn the huts so the smoke prevents the helicopter from seeing us"". He said that by some good luck, the rebels did not have matches on them to light the grass which they had pulled from my hut to torch it. He said that the rebels had wanted to use the firewood that was burning in the cooking place in my hut, but had dropped the grass and run because of the pressure from the soldiers coming on foot and the helicopter. Returning abductees also said rebels were burning the huts for this same reason. I cannot recall their names. 37, Some days after the attack; a Jetter was dropped by the rebels stating that if camp residents were still found in the camp by a later dat.e in October 2003 (I trunk it was about 15 or 25 October) they would be killed. The letter stated that all people should leave the camp and go back to their homes. At that time, some of those who had any cash took their families away to other camps. Others moved to other districts such as Masindi district and Lira district. I read the letter at the LC-3 chairman\'s office, but I cannot recall who wrote the letter from amongst the rebels. When the rebels write letters they sign which commander has written it. 1 think the top of the letter had \'LRA\' written on it and one of the LRA commanders had signed it. 38. I have not heard of any phone call made by the rebels to any of the soldiers at the military barracks at Pajule, or any letter from the rebels threatening an attack at the camp prior to the attack on I 0 October 2003.

But I only learnt later that these commanders to whose homes they had been distributed in Kitgum, had made them their ""wives\' some time after this first meeting with KONY in Kitgum, I learnt this from speaking to individual Lwala girls. I also heard from a wife of OTII that OTTI said to her that KONY had issued an order that those girls who were old enough should be made the commanders\' wives. This is what I meant when I said before that girls were selected as wives some months after we met KONY in Kitgum that first time. 43.

I do not know whether Dominic ONG WEN -0r ODOMI received any girls from Lwala School. I do not know Dominic ONG WEN by any other name; nor ODOMI by any other name. 41. About a week after the attack at Pajule I was taken to the sickbay, which was, close to Patongo or Okwang in Pader along the banks of Agago. This place is not near Lira. I was left at the sickbay and the group of OTfl was going to travel to Teso. I stayed at this sickbay from about October 2003 until my escape inl- Some injured at the attack in Pajule were also taken to the sickbay. I escaped from this sickbay after I heard OTII\'s plans to make me his wife. 1 believe I was left there because I could hardly walk and because they were afraid that ifI was brought back to Teso I could escape. I remember reaching Lango with the group of Major -1who was a commander in charge of the sickbay. I had said previously that it was in December 2003 that I had tried to escape withj-from O\'TTl, but I remember it was about October 2003 before the attack at Pajule as we had planned to celebrate Independence Day back home. 8 Witness statement o~ '"

I attach as annex ""B and C"" two copies of the same list of numbers of people killed, abducted, huts burnt, and households which had properties looted on 10 October 2003 in the six parishes of Pajule sub-county within Pajule IDP camp. Annex ""B and C"" reflect a summary of information collected for each parish (block) for Pajule sub-county. As explained my source of information for the numbers of people killed for each parish (block) was not only the block leaders but also from my discussions directly with the relatives of the dead who came to 44. I did not take any further record of anybody abducted from the camp on 10 October 2003, who was later reported to be killed by rebels. I understand that there is a list of names of the dead related to the 10 October 2003 attack at the LC-3s office. which was compiled for guests attending the commemoration service for victims. I do not know who compiled the list. 43. We did not write a list of those who were injured. I do not know how many people were injured. Some of the injured were taken to Caritas, and others were taken to Kitgum hospital. The Pajule dispensary was not in full operation then, but some peop1e were taken there for treatment. There were also some clinics within the camp that treated people with first aid. 42. Separate to my records each block leader was instructed and required under regulations to keep records including of those killed. The block leaders should have their own written records of the names, villages, parish, sex, age and names of parents of each of the dead. We have one common office, where each block leader keeps their records in different boxes for different parishes. As a camp commandant I can request this information/ records from block leaders whenever needed. 41. I signed annex ""\'A"" on 20 October 2003~ when details of nine dead people had been recorded, I believe that eight out of the nine are civilians, al1hough 1 am only certain of seven of them. I run not certain if Ojok Mathew was a civilian. Oyet Santo was an LDU soldier killed near the barracks. On 21 October 2003 when I went to meet with LC-3 chairman of Pajule sub-county, Mr. Lokilamoi, 1 was provided by his office with three additional names of those killed. I cannot recall the name of the person from his office who gave me this information. I was told that the bodies of the three dead people were found in the bush aft.er the attack on l 0 October 2003, but it was assumed rebels had killed them on the same day of the attack. I am not certain if these three dead people were civilians or soldiers. I obtained annex \'A\' from my office, where it was stored. confirm the dead person\'s details including their names, their village, and their age. I wrote down this information in my list. From the name of the village I was able to record the name of the parish, and from the name of the person I was able to record their sex. I had also seen the dead bodies ofOnek Pangrasio and Kinyera Lacung for myself. '"

T cannot confirm this number, for instance as it was assumed that some people thought to be missing had run away to relatives outside the camp. This prevented the lists being compiled on the same day as the attack. The lists were being compiled slowly as information kept trickling in. I do not know how many abductees have returned, as those returning were not all reporting to my office, but were reporting to the office of the LC-3 and other places such as the nearby camps where they had relatives. nearby barracks to where they were and from where they were taken straight to a reception centre. 49. I attach as annex ""E"", ""\'F"", ""G,"" and ""H"" the original records of those reported to the block leaders as abducted by LRA, by their relatives. These annexes were compiled by each block leader of the six parishes of Pajule sub-county from l 0 October until about 19 October 2003. We had called for the camp residents of Pajule sub-county to go to the block leaders of their parish if they had lost a relative. These block leaders or those they delegated recorded the abductee\'s names, village, parish, sex, and age. The block leaders\' lists came separately to me, but they had all provided these records to me by 20 October 2003, when T finished compiling my lists attached as annexes \'B\' and \'C\'. These lists only cover those reported as abducted from Pajule sub-county and not from Lapul county within the camp. I obtained these records from my office, where J have been storing them. On 20 October 2003 I used the numbers of abductecs recorded in annexes \'\'E"", ""\'F,""\' ""G"", and ""H"", for the numbers recorded as abducted in annex ""B"" and ""\'C"". 48. It was the block leaders and not me who compiled the information of those camp residents from Pajule sub-county reported as abducted and households reported as looted, which I summarised for annexes\' B\' and \'C\'. 47. I attach as annex \'D\' a fist of all those whose homes were burnt that were recorded within both Pajule and Lapul sub-county within the camp and who received help from the Church of Uganda. The Catechist from the Church of Uganda brought me information about ten huts that were burnt in the Lapul county side of the camp. However, I do not know if this was the total number of huts burnt on the Lapul side of the camp. I cannot recall the name of the Catechist. I compiled this list attached as annex \'D\' and obtained it from my office where I had been storing it 46. On 11 October 2003, we recorded those huts that were burnt. I counted huts burnt within each block of the Pajule sub-county part of the camp at the same time as the block leaders and others. We counted 23 huts burnt on the Pajule sub-county side of the camp. This is the information T listed in annexes \'B\' and \'C\'. my office. I obtained these annexes \'B\' and \'C\' from my file for the sub-county at my office. '"
